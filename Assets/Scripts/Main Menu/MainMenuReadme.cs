	 * Hi there, you probably have some questions, including but not limited to:
	 * -what is the basis of this Main Menu Scene?
	 * -why is this main menu scene here?
	 * -what is my purpose in life?
	 * 
	 * I'm going to ignore the latter two questions and just answer the first
	 * because yeah!
	 * 
	 * The Main Menu Scene is based on two online resources I found:
	 * 		This video for Main Menu-making: 
	 * 		https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/creating-a-scene-menu
	 * 
	 * 		And this answer about how to get the letters to highlight themselves when moused over
	 * 		http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/783279/46-ui-how-to-detect-mouse-over-on-button.html#
