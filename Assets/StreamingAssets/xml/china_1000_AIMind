      <description>China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a sovereign state in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a one-party state governed by the Communist Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces; five autonomous regions; four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing); two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau); and claims sovereignty over Taiwan.Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas.China is a cradle of civilization, with its known history beginning with an ancient civilization – one of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies known as dynasties. Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and reformed numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) replaced the last dynasty in 1912, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949, when it was defeated by the Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War. The Communist Party established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the ROC government relocated to Taiwan with its present capital in Taipei. Both the ROC and PRC continue to claim to be the legitimate government of all China.China had the largest economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 2014, it is the world's second-largest economy by nominal total GDP and largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army and second-largest defence budget. The PRC has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the BCIM and the G-20. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.</description>

      <description>The President of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is the head of state of the People's Republic of China (PRC). On paper, the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited powers.  However, in recent years the General Secretary of the Communist Party has also served simultaneously as President, and his election to the post marks his ascension as paramount leader of the country. The office is classified as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post.The office was first established in the PRC Constitution of 1954 and successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution and the office was abolished. The office was officially scrapped under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers. The official English-language translation of the title was \"Chairman\"; after 1982, this translation was changed to \"President\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.Under the present Chinese constitution, the Presidency is a prestigious but largely ceremonial position holding few powers in its own right, most significantly the right to nominate the Premier. Most of the few powers the President does possess are subject to the approval of the National People's Congress, by whom the President is elected by for up to two terms of five years each.However, since the presidency of Jiang Zemin, every President has also simultaneously held the positions of CPC General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, which, unlike the Presidency, wield significant power. As a result of this convention, the President, the de jure head of state, also controls the Chinese  Communist Party, state and military, therefore being China's de facto \"paramount leader\". That is to say, present-day paramount leaders hold the office of President, but the President is not necessarily the paramount leader, as was the case between 1959 and 1993.The current President is Xi Jinping, who took office on 14 March 2013.</description>

      <description>Zhang Dejiang (born 4 November 1946) is a Chinese politician and a high-ranking official in the Communist Party of China. He currently serves as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, roughly the equivalent of a speaker of the National Assembly in other countries. He is also a third ranked member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, deputy head of the National Security Commission and the top official responsible for Hong Kong and Macau affairs. Zhang has extensive regional governance experience unmatched by his Standing Committee contemporaries. He has successively served as the Party Secretary of the provinces of Jilin, Zhejiang and Guangdong. The SARS outbreak began in Guangdong and occurred during Zhang's term as the provincial party chief there. He served as Vice-Premier in charge of energy, telecommunications, and transportation under Premier Wen Jiabao, widely known for being Wen's 'troubleshooter' of choice, leading various disaster response task forces, such as during the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion and the 2011 Wenzhou train collision. In March 2012, Zhang was tapped to replace Bo Xilai as the party secretary of Chongqing. Zhang also held a seat on the 25-member Politburo of the Communist Party of China since 2002. After serving two terms on the body, Zhang was promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee at the 18th Party Congress in 2012.</description>

      <description>The Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, sometimes also referred to informally as the \"Prime Minister\", is the Leader of the State Council of China (the \"Central People's Government\" constitutionally since 1954), who is the head of government and holds the highest rank (Level 1) in the Civil Service. This position was originally known as Premier of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government (Chinese: 中央人民政府政务院总理) and changed to its current name in 1954.The Premier is formally approved by the National People's Congress upon the nomination of the President. In practice, the candidate is chosen through an informal process within the Communist Party of China. Both the President and the Premier are selected once every five years. The Premier has always been a member of the powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China.The current Premier is Li Keqiang, who took office on 15 March 2013.</description>

      <description>Shanghai is the largest Chinese city by population and the largest city proper by population in the world. It is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of China, with a population of more than 24 million as of  2014.  It is a global financial center, and a transport hub with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast.  The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.For centuries a major administrative, shipping, and trading town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to European recognition of its favorable port location and economic potential. The city was one of five forced open to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War while the subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a center of commerce between east and west, and became the undisputed financial hub of the Asia Pacific in the 1930s. However, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was reoriented to focus on socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city.Shanghai is a popular tourist destination renowned for its historical landmarks such as The Bund, City God Temple and Yu Garden as well as the extensive Lujiazui skyline, many skyscrapers, and major museums including the Shanghai Museum and the China Art Museum. It has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of mainland China.</description>

      <description>A one-party state, single-party state, one-party system, or single-party system is a type of state in which one political party has the right to form the government, usually based on the existing constitution. All other parties are either outlawed or allowed to take only a limited and controlled participation in elections. Sometimes the term de facto one-party state is used to describe a dominant-party system that, unlike the one-party state, allows (at least nominally) democratic multiparty elections, but the existing practices or balance of political power effectively prevent the opposition from winning the elections.</description>

      <description>Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China and one of the most populous cities in the world.Its total population in 2013 was 21,150,000. The city proper is the 2nd most populous in the world. The metropolis, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China.Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai and is the nation's political, cultural and educational center. It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies, and is a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks.  The Beijing Capital International Airport is the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic.The city's history dates back three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for much of the past eight centuries. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates, and its art treasures and universities have made it a center of culture and art in China. Encyclopædia Britannica notes that \"few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of an area as immense as China.\"  Beijing has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, Great Wall, and the Grand Canal. Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will make it the first city to ever host both events.</description>

      <description>Xi Jinping (simplified Chinese: 习近平; traditional Chinese: 習近平; pinyin: Xí Jìnpíng, pronounced [ɕǐ tɕînpʰǐŋ]; born 15 June 1953) is the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, the president of the People's Republic of China, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission. As Xi holds the top offices of the party and the military, in addition to being the head of state through the office of president, he is sometimes informally referred to as China's "paramount leader". As general secretary, Xi is also an ex officio member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's de facto top decision-making body.Son of communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, Xi Jinping rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. He served as the governor of Fujian between 1999 and 2002, then as governor and party secretary of the neighboring Zhejiang between 2002 and 2007. Following the dismissal of Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to Shanghai as the party secretary for a brief period in 2007. Xi joined the Politburo standing committee and central secretariat, in October 2007, and was groomed to become Hu Jintao's successor. He served as vice-president, between 2008 and 2013.Xi is now the leader of the People's Republic's fifth generation of leadership. Since assuming leadership, he has initiated an unprecedented and far-reaching campaign against corruption, called for further market economic reforms, governing according to the law and strengthening legal institutions, and an emphasis on individual and national aspirations under the neologism "Chinese Dream".Xi has also imposed restrictions over ideological discourse, attempted to entrench and legitimize the authority of the Communist Party over Chinese society, while also introducing far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and ensure internal unity. He has significantly centralized institutional power through taking on a wide range of leadership positions himself, including chairing the newly formed National Security Commission, as well as new steering committees on overall reform, military reform, and the Internet. Xi has also championed a more assertive foreign policy, particularly in relation to Sino-Japanese relations, disputes in the South China Sea, involvement in Asian regional affairs, and initiatives related to energy and natural resources.</description>

      <description>Standard Chinese, also known as Modern Standard Mandarin, also often referred to as Putonghua or simply \"Mandarin\", is a standard language that is the sole official language of both China and Taiwan, and also one of the four official languages of Singapore. The pronunciation of the standard is based on the Beijing dialect, its vocabulary is drawn from Mandarin dialects, and the grammar is based on literature in the modern written vernacular.Like other varieties of Chinese, Standard Chinese is a tonal language. It has more initial consonants but fewer vowels, final consonants and tones than southern varieties. Standard Chinese is an analytic language, though with many compound words. Like other varieties of Chinese it is a topic-prominent language and has subject–verb–object word order. The language is written using either traditional or simplified Chinese characters, augmented by Hanyu Pinyin romanization or Bopomofo for pedagogical purposes.</description>

      <description>Written Vernacular Chinese (simplified Chinese: 白话; traditional Chinese: 白話; pinyin: báihuà) refers to forms of written Chinese based on the varieties of Chinese spoken throughout China, in contrast to Classical Chinese, the written standard used during imperial China up to the early twentieth century. A written vernacular based on Mandarin Chinese was used in novels in the Ming and Qing dynasties, and later refined by intellectuals associated with the May Fourth Movement. Since the early 1920s, this modern vernacular form has been the standard style of writing for speakers of all varieties of Chinese throughout mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore as the written form of Modern Standard Chinese. This is commonly called Standard Written Chinese or Modern Written Chinese to avoid ambiguity with spoken vernaculars, with the written vernaculars of earlier eras, and with modern unofficial written vernaculars such as written Cantonese or written Hokkien.</description>

      <description>Li Keqiang (simplified Chinese: 李克强; traditional Chinese: 李克強; pinyin: Lǐ Kèqiáng, Mandarin: [lì kʰɤ̂tɕʰjǎŋ]; born 1 July 1955) is the current Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. An economist by training, Li is China's head of government as well as one of the leading figures behind Chinese economic policy. He is also the second-ranked member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the de facto top decision-making body of the country. Li is a major part of the "fifth generation of Chinese leadership."Li rose through the ranks through his involvement in the Communist Youth League. From 1998 to 2004, Li served as the Governor of Henan and the province's party secretary. From 2004 to 2007 he served as the Party Secretary of Liaoning, the top political office in the province. From 2008 to 2013, Li served as the first-ranked Vice-Premier under then-Premier Wen Jiabao, overseeing a broad portfolio which included economic development, price controls, finance, climate change, and macroeconomic management.Given his Youth League experience, Li has generally been considered a political ally of former leader Hu Jintao. Li assumed the post of Premier in 2013, and has facilitated the Chinese government's shifting of priorities from export-led growth to a greater focus on internal consumption. Li has also been a major force behind the implementation of the "comprehensively deepening reforms" announced in the fall of 2013.</description>

      <description>Socialism with Chinese characteristics, meaning socialism adapted to Chinese conditions, is the official ideology of the Communist Party of China (CPC) based upon scientific socialism. This ideology supports the creation of a socialist market economy dominated by the public sector since China is, as claimed by the CPC, in the primary stage of socialism. The People's Republic of China (PRC) government maintains that it has not abandoned Marxism but has developed many of the terms and concepts of Marxist theory to accommodate its new economic system. The CPC argues that socialism is compatible with these economic policies. In current Chinese Communist thinking, China is in the primary stage of socialism—a view which explains the PRC government's flexible economic policies to develop into an industrialized nation.</description>

      <description>The renminbi is the official currency of the People's Republic of China.  The name (simplified Chinese: 人民币; traditional Chinese: 人民幣; pinyin: rénmínbì) literally means \"people's currency\". The yuan (Chinese: 元/圆; pinyin: yuán) (sign: ¥) is the basic unit of the renminbi, but is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts. The distinction between the terms renminbi and yuan is similar to that between sterling and pound, which respectively refer to the British currency and its primary unit. One yuan is subdivided into 10 jiao (Chinese: 角; pinyin: jiǎo), and a jiao in turn is subdivided into 10 fen (Chinese: 分; pinyin: fēn).The ISO code for renminbi (which may also be used for the yuan) is CNY (an abbreviation for \"Chinese yuan\"), or also CNH when traded in off-shore markets such as Hong Kong. The currency is often abbreviated RMB, or indicated by the yuan sign ¥.   The latter may be written CN¥ to distinguish it from other currencies with the same symbol (such as the Japanese yen). In Chinese texts the currency may also be indicated with the Chinese character for the yuan, 圆 (or 元 informally). The renminbi is legal tender in mainland China, but not in Hong Kong or Macau. Renminbi is sometimes accepted in Hong Kong and Macau, and are easily exchanged in the two territories, with banks in Hong Kong allowing people to maintain accounts in RMB. The currency is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China.Until 2005, the value of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar. As China pursued its historical transition from central planning to a market economy, and increased its participation in foreign trade, the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry. It has previously been claimed that the renminbi's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity (see below). More recently, however, appreciation actions by the Chinese government, as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks, have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012. Since 2006, the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies. The Chinese government has announced that it will gradually increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the world's 8th most traded currency in 2013, and 5th in 2015.  The yuan will be included in the basket of currencies used by the IMF (reserve currency) in 2016.</description>

      <description>Hu Yaobang (November 20, 1915 – April 15, 1989) was a high-ranking official of the People's Republic of China. He achieved his most senior status within the Communist Party of China from 1981 to 1987, first as Party chairman from 1981 to 1982, then as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1982 to 1987. Hu joined the Chinese Communist Party in the 1930s, and rose to prominence as a comrade of Deng Xiaoping. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Hu was purged, recalled, and purged again, following the political career of Deng.After Deng rose to power, following the death of Mao Zedong, Deng promoted Hu to a series of high political positions. Throughout the 1980s Hu pursued a series of economic and political reforms under the direction of Deng. Hu's political and economic reforms made him the enemy of several powerful Party elders, who opposed free market reforms and attempts to make China's government more transparent. When widespread student protests occurred across China in 1987, Hu's political opponents successfully blamed Hu for the disruptions, claiming that Hu's \"laxness\" and \"bourgeois liberalization\" had either led to, or worsened, the protests. Hu was forced to resign as Party general secretary in 1987, but was allowed to retain a seat in the Politburo.Hu's position as Party general secretary was taken by Zhao Ziyang, who continued many of Hu's economic and political reforms. A day after Hu's death, in 1989, a small-scale demonstration commemorated him and demanded that the government reassess his legacy. A week later, the day before Hu's funeral, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, leading to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Following the government's suppression of the 1989 protests, the Chinese government censored the details of Hu's life inside mainland China, but it officially rehabilitated his image and lifted its censorship restrictions on the 90th anniversary of Hu's birth, in 2005.</description>

      <description>John Dudgeon (1837 – 1901) was a Scottish physician who spent nearly 40 years in China as a doctor, surgeon, translator, and medical missionary.Dudgeon attended the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, in the latter of which he graduated M.D. and Master of Surgery in 1862. In 1863, he was appointed to the Medical Mission of the London Missionary Society to serve at the hospital in Peking established by William Lockhart, arriving in China in December 1863. He was also Medical Attendant to the British Legation in Peking (modern-day Beijing) from 1864-1868. Dudgeon was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at the Imperial College (Tongwen guan) during the 1870s and 1880s. In Wanderings in China, Constance Frederica Gordon Cumming wrote:Even when the health of the city is at its normal condition the cares of such a hospital as this are serious, and to me it is a source of amazement how Dr. Dudgeon gets through his daily work. To begin with he must personally prescribe for, on an average, 120 hospital patients every morning, besides an extensive outside practice, which includes several of the foreign Legations, and involves driving long distances in the blazing heat and in the horrible springless carts. Two hours a day are devoted to translating useful books into Chinese with his students, besides the labour of preparing and delivering his lectures at the Government College.He was an accomplished Chinese scholar, and during his long residence at Pekin he studied the manners and customs of the inhabitants, and the semi-annual reports that he forwarded to the Chinese Maritime Customs Service contain a large amount of valuable information regarding the climatic condition, physical features and drainage, and general habits of the people bearing upon health. He was the author of an Historical Sketch of the Ecclesiastical, Political, and Commercial Relation of Russia with China, of a Chinese work 脱影奇观 On the Principles and Practice of Photography, the first of its kind, and of an article in the Pekin Magazine (in Chinese) on the virtues of quinine, in which he pointed out the dangers of the imported spurious article. To the Chinese Medical Journal he contributed papers on A Modern Chinese Anatomist, and A Chapter on Chinese Surgery. He also made several contributions to other medical journals, especially on subjects connected with the medical practice and materia medica of China.   Various editions of his Kung Fu books are still available to purchase :  \"Kung Fu or Taoist Medical Gymnastics: The Art of Shaolin Kung Fu, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Qigong Beginning Practice\" and \"Chinese healing arts: Internal Kung-Fu\" co authored with William Berk. Over a period of 10 years he translated both Gray's Anatomy and Holden's Osteology into an 18 volume Chinese edition.Dudgeon said that in China, \"Infanticide does not prevail to the extent so generally believed among us, and in the north it does not exist at all.\"Dudgeon resigned from the London Mission Society in 1884 after conflicts over the prioritisation of evangelical and medical work. Thereafter he continued in private practice in Peking until his death in February 1901.</description>

He studied at Teachers College, Columbia University and returned to China to champion progressive education. His career in China as a liberal educator was not derivative of John Dewey, as some have alleged, but creative and adaptive. He returned to China at a time when the American influence was zesty and self-confident, and his very name at that time (zhixing) meant \"knowledge-action,\" reflecting the catch-phrase of the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming which implied that once knowledge (zhi) had been obtained, then action (xing) would be easy.</description>

In subsequent years, Huang began to cover the topic of life on extrasolar planets and the prerequisites thereof, coining the term \"habitable zone\" to refer to the region around a star where planets could support liquid water at their surfaces at a 1959 conference of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.</description>

He studied art and art theory in France from 1928–1932. Upon his return to China, he taught in Shanghai and worked as a journalist and art critic until he took up translating. His translations, which remain highly regarded, include Voltaire, Balzac and Romain Rolland. He developed his own style, the \"Fu Lei style,\" and his own translation theory. He advocated the transfer of the original spirit of a literary work. A good translation should be \"alike in spirit and appearance\" but if the translator struggles with transmitting both the grammatical appearance and the literary spirit, he should try to save the latter.In 1957 he was labelled a rightist. In 1966, at the start of the Cultural Revolution, he and his wife committed suicide. His family letters to his son Fou Ts'ong, a world-renowned pianist, were published posthumously and became a bestseller in China.</description>

Originally groomed as the successor to Chairman Mao, Liu antagonized Mao in the early 1960s before the Cultural Revolution and was criticized, then purged, by Mao starting in 1966. Liu disappeared from public life in 1968 and was labelled the "commander of China's bourgeoisie headquarters", China's foremost 'capitalist-roader', and a traitor to the revolution.He died under harsh treatment in late 1969, but was posthumously rehabilitated by Deng Xiaoping's government in 1980 and granted a national memorial service.</description>

      <description>Wu Huawen (simplified Chinese: 吴化文; traditional Chinese: 吳化文; pinyin: Wú Huàwén, 1904–1962) was a military commander during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. During his career, he switched his allegiance three times, first from the Kuomintang to a Japanese puppet government, then back to the Kuomintang, and finally to the communist People's Liberation Army.In 1928, Wu Huawen became Head of Training Department, Luoyang Junior Military Officer School of the North-western Army. After that came appointments as Chief of Staff and commanding officer of the Reconnaissance Regiment in the 25th Division of the 2nd Army Group (1928–1930), Deputy Head of the Higher Training Corps of the 3rd Route Army (1930–1931), commanding officer of the pistol brigade, 3rd Route Army (1931–1938), commanding officer of the 28th Independent Brigade, 3rd Route Army (1938–1939), and general officer commanding the 4th New Division (1939–1943).In 1943, a few years after the execution of his superior Han Fuju (in 1938), he defected to the Japanese, taking many of  Han's troops with him. In the same year, he joined the Reorganized National Government of China, a puppet state under Japanese control. He served as Commander in Chief of the 3rd Front Army for Wang Jingwei's government until 1945, when he rejoined the Kuomintang government. From 1945 until 1948, he held several commands: general officer commanding the 5th New Route Army and general officer commanding the Southern Jin-Pu Railway Garrison (1945–1946), commanding officer of the 7th Column (1946), commanding officer 2nd Shandong Security Column (1946–1947), and general officer commanding the 84th Division (1947–1948).In 1948, he was given command of the 96th Army and was tasked of defending the outer ring of fortifications in the Battle of Jinan against the attack by the communist People's Liberation Army. Before the beginning of the battle, Wu Huawen defected to the communist side taking a large number of troops with him and hence delivering a decisive blow to the Kuomintang defense of the city. After his defection, he was given the post of general officer commanding the 35th Army in the People's Liberation Army, which also incorporated the troops he had taken with him.</description>

      <description>Lee Hoe-yeong, or Lee Hoe-Young (Hangul: 이회영; hanja: 李會榮), also known by Pen name as Woodang (Hangul: 우당; hanja: 友堂), (March 17, 1867-November 17, 1932) was a Korean independence activist, anarchist and also one of the founders of Shinheung Military Academy(Hangul: 신흥 무관 학교) in Manchuria. He used his entire fortune, worth about two trillion won(1.7 billion dollars) today, to fight against the Japanese colonization of Korea.He is the elder brother of Yi Si-yeong, future Vice President of the Republic of Korea.Born in a renowned Nobility family, where his ancestors used to be appointed as senior Government Officials during the Joseon Dynasty, he and his brothers (with the exception of his eldest brother)have decided to flee Korea, rather than becoming the oppressed. His siblings are: Lee Gun-yeong (이건영,李健榮)  (1853–1940)-Eldest brother Lee Seok-yeong  (이석영,李石榮)  (1855–1934)-2nd brother, deceased by starvation in Shanghai,China Lee Cheol-yeong (이철영,李哲榮) (1863–1925)-3rd brother Lee Si-yeong (이시영,李始榮) (1868–1953)-5th brother Lee Ho-yeong  (이호영,李護榮) (?-1933)-6th and youngest brother.He and his entire family went missing in 1933, and never to be heard again.When he arrived in China,he stayed at Manchuria, before moving to Beijing and later Shanghai.He was arrested upon arrival from Shanghai at Dalian,and later imprisoned in the infamous Lushun Prison,and later died on November 17, 1932. However,his cause of death was a mystery, and the Japanese authority claims that he had hanged himself on the window bars of a Police Station, using a hemp cloth. However, the claim was refuted by the Koreans,as they claimed that he was killed by the Japanese. Upon his death,his remains was quickly cremated at the same day and his ashes was later brought back to Japan-ruled Korea,and later re-interred at Seoul National Cemetery, years after the Korean independence. He was posthumously awarded with the Order of Merit for National Foundation in 1962. And in 2000,the Chinese Government proclaimed him as a \"Patriotic martyr of the anti-imperialism/anti-Japanese revolution\" for his struggle against the Japanese Imperialism in China. In 2010,a 5-part drama series was aired by KBS in commemorate of his struggle,titled Freedom Fighter, Lee Hoe Young(자유인 이회영) and was aired on August 29, 2010,the date of the centenary of the Forced Annexation of Korea by Japan.</description>

She was a member of the Soong family and, together with her siblings, played a prominent role in China's politics prior to 1949. She has become known as the "mother of modern China".After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, she held several prominent positions in the new government, including Vice President of China, traveled abroad during the early 1950s, representing it at a number of international activities. During the Cultural Revolution, however, she was heavily criticized; in one incident in 1966, her parents' grave was destroyed by Red Guards. Soong survived the Cultural Revolution, but appeared less frequently after 1976. During her final illness in May 1981, she was given the special title of Honorary President of the People's Republic of China.</description>

Born poor in 1886 in Sichuan, Zhu was adopted by a wealthy uncle at age nine; this prosperity provided him a superior early education that led to his admission into a military academy. After his time at the academy, he joined a rebel army, and soon became a warlord. It was after this period that he adopted communism. He ascended through the ranks of the Red Army as it closed in on securing the nation. By the time China was under Mao's control, Zhu was a high-ranking official within the Communist Party of China. He served as Commander-in-Chief during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Zhu remained a prominent political figure until his death in 1976. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, in 1955 Zhu became one of the Ten Marshals of the People's Liberation Army, of which he is regarded as a principal founder.</description>

      <description>Wu Yee-sun (Chinese: 伍宜孫) (born 1900 in Xingtan, Shunde, Guangdong, China and died 2005 in Hong Kong) was a Hong Kong entrepreneur and billionaire who founded the Wing Lung Bank.Although he was born into a well-known family, times were difficult and he had to leave school at 14. The family suffered through a number of disasters and, as the oldest son, Yee-Sun left Guandong Province to seek work in Hong Kong to help support his family in the 1920s. In 1933, he and some friends established \"Wing Lung Money Exchange\" (later Wing Lung Bank) in Central, Hong Kong. In later years contributions towards setting up or improving hospitals, clinics, universities and schools in Mainland China and Hong Kong were made in the name of Wu or his father. On May 11, 2005, Dr. Wu died in Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital at the age of 105.Wu Yee-sun's father, Wu York-Yu (Chinese: 伍若瑜), and grandfather, Wu Yee-Hong (Chinese: 伍宜康), were both practitioners of the \"grow and clip\" method of training trees into artistic forms (penjing), which came to be known as the \"Lingnan School\". The method requires great patience, dedication, careful attention to detail, and a lighter, more natural approach to the caring of these plants. The technique is different from the Japanese bonsai technique of wrapping branches with wire to bend them to the desired shape. The tropical trees more favored in the \"Lingnan School\" are quicker growers and respond better to \"grow and clip\" than the more temperate specimens used by the Japanese.In 1967 Wu and his friends established the Man Lung (\"scholar-farmer\") Garden as a place to meet, discuss, study, and exhibit. Two years later, he published and distributed Man Lung Garden Artistic Pot Plants, the definitive book on Chinese penjing of the Lingnan style, \"fearing that the Chinese art of training pot plants might [otherwise] someday be lost.\"   In 1974 an enlarged edition of the book came out as Man Lung Artistic Pot Plants with the addition of the history and evolution of artistic pot plants, notes from presentations, and over 100 additional photographs. Some 10,000 copies were donated to leading libraries, universities, and bonsai lovers all over the world to commemorate Wu's retirement from the chairmanship of Wing Lung Bank.Over the years,  Wu's personal collection in Hong Kong grew to nearly 400 specimens of penjing. Many of these he donated to public institutions in Europe and North America, including the Seventh University of Paris (France, five trees in c.1982), Montreal Botanical Garden (Canada, thirty trees in 1985, over twenty more in 1987), and the Sun Yat Sen Park in Vancouver (Canada). Other trees have gone to the Botanical Park of the Nanjing Institute of the Chinese Academy of Science, the Hong Kong Baptist College (2000) and the Former Government House, Hong Kong. All of these penjing exhibitions are open to the public.(In the 1970s Wu had offered the U.S. fifty of his penjing on the condition that the usual importation procedure of bare-rooting and fumigation be forgone, as this would have been fatal to these very old trees. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture refused to make an exception to its rule, although the Bicentennial trees from Japan had been excepted earlier. The Japanese trees harbored twenty-three identifiable pests.  After a few years of negotiation, the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada did issue a special phytosanitary certificate for Wu's trees, although two of his Japanese black pines could not be imported. The U.S received 24 of Wu's trees in 1986 to begin a two-year quarantine before being exhibited. The Wu Chinese Garden Pavilion at the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum on the grounds of the U.S. National Arboretum was opened in 1996.)Wu occasionally hosted individuals and groups from around the world who travelled to see his garden on the beautifully raised terrace fronting his house, which itself was built on a steep mountainside overlooking Hong Kong public Man Lung Garden was opened at Hong Kong Baptist University in the year 2000. A website for the garden (http://www.manlungpenjing.org) was set up for discussion and exchange of information. Wu instructed his son Norman Po-Man (one of thirteen children) to take color photographs and publish a hardcover souvenir volume; this comprehensive collection of penjing in full color called Man Lung Penjing was published in 2002, covering over seventy years of study and is a record of Wu's creative style.A minor planet was discovered at the Purple Mountain Observatory at Nanking, China in 1979. Provisionally designated as 1979 XO, in 1998 this 3,570th known asteroid was named 3570 Wuyeesun after Wu.</description>

      <description>Wang Ganchang (Chinese: 王淦昌; pinyin: Wáng Gànchāng; Wade–Giles: Wang Kan-ch'ang) (May 28, 1907 – December 10, 1998) was a nuclear physicist from China. He was one of the initiators of research in China in nuclear physics, cosmic rays and particle physics. Wang figured among the top leaders, pioneers and scientists of the Chinese nuclear deterrent program. He was a member of the Chinese Academy of Science and a member of the Chinese Communist party.In 1930, Wang first proposed the use of a cloud chamber to study a new type of high-energy ray induced by the bombardment of beryllium with α particles, an experiment conducted one year later by the English physicist James Chadwick, who thus discovered a new type of particle, the neutron, for which he won the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics.Wang first proposed the use of beta-capture to detect the neutrino in 1941. James Allen employed his suggestion and found evidence for the existence of the neutrino in 1942. Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan detected the neutrino via the inverse beta-decay reaction in 1956, for which, forty years later, they were awarded the 1995Nobel Prize in Physics.Wang also led a group to discover the anti-sigma minus hyperon particle at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia in 1959.After May 1950, Wang became researcher and vice-director of the Institute of Modern Physics (中国科学院近代物理研究所). He was vice-director of the Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. From spring 1969, he was vice-director of the Ninth Research Institute (二机部第九研究院), predecessor of the China Academy of Engineering Physics. He was director of the China Institute of Atomic Energy (二机部副部长兼原子能研究所). He was deputy director of the Nuclear industry Science and Technology Commission (核工业部科技委). He was second vice-chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology. He was vice-chairman of the Chinese Physical Society (中国物理学会). He was first chairman of the Chinese Nuclear Society (中国核学会). He was a member of the 3rd through 16th National People's Congress Standing Committees of the Chinese government.In 2000, the Chinese Physical Society established five prizes in recognition of five pioneers of modern physics in China. The Wang Ganchang Prize is awarded to physicists in particle physics and inertial confinement fusion.</description>

He was born in Hunan.In the early 1930s Ren commanded the Sixth Red Army and occupied a soviet in Hunan, but he was forced to abandon his base after being pressured by Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns. In October 1934 Ren and his surviving forces joined the forces of He Long, who had set up a base in Guizhou. In the command structure of the new \"Second Front Army\", He became the military commander and Ren became its political commissar. He and Ren abandoned their base and participated in the Long March in 1935, a year after forces led by Mao Zedong and Zhu De were forced to abandon their own bases. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ren was the representative of the CCP at Communist International, Secretariat of the Communist Party of China and the Secretary of the Chinese Central Committee.Ren was considered a rising figure within the Chinese Communist Party until his death at the age of 46. He was the 5th most senior Party member of the Chinese Politburo before his death.</description>

      <description>Li Feng (Chinese: 栗峰; pinyin: Lì Fēng; c. 1977–July 29, 2003) was a Chinese teacher who was executed for sexually molesting and raping 19 girls.Li was an elementary school teacher in the city of Tonghua, in northeast China's Jilin province. He began teaching in 1998, and he began molesting his students in August of that year. He assaulted various girls in his class for the next four years. The victims were all under the age of 14.In August 2002, Li changed classes and tried to molest his new students. However, the girls in his new class rejected his advances. Three parents then complained about Li Feng's behavior to the school's principal; the principal told the parent to take the complaint to the city's education board and ask for Li Feng to be transferred to another school, and that the school had \"no authority\" to fire Li Feng. On September 2, 2002, the city's department of education suspended Li Feng from teaching, but added the stipulation that he would be put on \"observation\" for another year. Thereafter, Li Feng was transferred to work at the department of education.Li Feng's father, Li Fuchen (栗福臣), a local village chief and legislator, attempted to settle with the parents of the three children who filed complaints with the principal by giving each family 7,000 yuan (~$950), roughly equivalent at the time to an annual salary of a migrant labourer. Although initially the families seem to have been appeased by Li Fuchen's gestures, word of the case quickly spread in the city. Upon hearing word that Li Feng's father had paid off the three parents who complained to the school, the parents of the other victims decided to report Li Feng directly to the police.Li Feng, with the help of his father, attempted to escape the city to avoid arrest. He was officially fired from his job and the city revoked his teaching license. He was arrested by authorities in September 8, 2002. The case garnered significant notoriety and earned the attention of top Jilin provincial government officials, including Party Secretary Wang Yunkun and Deputy Party Secretary Quan Zezhu, and highlighted the failure of the city's education bureaucrats and the school board itself in addressing the case appropriately. The case was also notable for the silence of the victims and the failure of parents to detect the abuse of their children despite protestations by the pupils themselves. The principal of the school Li Feng worked at was fired after the investigation. It was later discovered that Li Feng had raped nine students in total and molested ten others. On March 14, 2003, Li was sentenced to death by the Higher People's Court of Jilin province and executed in July of the same year.Li's father, who tried to help his son avoid arrest, was convicted of aiding and abetting in a crime and hiding a criminal, and sentenced to two years in prison.</description>

As a head of the official Bureau of History of the Ming dynasty, Song Lian directed compilation of the official dynastic history of the preceding defunct Yuan Dynasty.The compilation of the History of Yuan, commissioned by the court of the Ming Dynasty, was completed in 1370, it formalized the official history of the preceding Chingizid Yuan Dynasty. Under the guidance of Song Lian, the official dynastic history broke with the old Confucian historiographical tradition, and established a new historical paradigm professing that the influence of history was equal in influence to the great Confucian classics in directing the human affairs.In Asian historiography, Yuanshi is a major source for the history of Chinese, Tungusic, Mongol, and Turkic peoples.</description>

      <description>Luis Ruiz Suárez S.J. (September 21, 1913 – July 26, 2011) was a Spanish-born Macanese Jesuit priest and missionary. Father Suarez, who founded the Caritas Macau charity, and focused much of his work in Macau and southern China. His work earned him several nicknames - \"Luk Ngai\" in Cantonese, \"Father of the Poor\" and \"Angel of Macau.\"Luis Ruiz Suarez was born in Gijón, Asturias, Spain, on September 21, 1913. Ruiz joined the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, in 1930. The Jesuits sent him from Spain to China in 1941 as a missionary. He arrived in Beijing, where he studied Mandarin Chinese, and was then sent to Shanghai, where he studied philosophy. He was forced to cease his work due to the escalation of World War II and the Japanese occupation of China. Father Suarez resumed his work in 1945. His superiors stationed him in Xian County in Hebei province. He was arrested, briefly imprisoned and expelled from the newly formed People's Republic of China in 1949 following the Chinese Communist Revolution. While in prison, Suarez contracted typhoid before his expulsion from China. Father Suarez left China for Hong Kong, before settling in Macau in 1951.In 1951, Father Ruiz's Jesuit provincial sent him to Macau, a Portuguese colony along the southern Chinese coast, to recover from his typhoid. He resided in Macau for the rest of his life. Suarez soon began working with refugees fleeing from the People's Republic of China after just a few months in Macau. He used the official Jesuit residence in Macau, which was called Casa Ricci, as a temporary shelter for the mainland Chinese refugees.  This led to the establishment of Father Ruiz's first charity in Macau, the Ricci Centre for Social Services. The center furnished refugees with housing, educational opportunities, documentation, child care and employment.Father Ruiz soon began work with other groups in Macau as the refugees were able to leave the Portuguese territory. He founded the first housing in Macau specifically established to house the elderly. The Ricci Centre for Social Services later evolved into the Caritas Macau charitable organization during the 1970s. Under Caritas, Suarez opened five centers throughout Macau which provided services for the mentally disabled.During the 1980s, Ruiz began working with lepers in Guangdong province, with the help of an order of Catholic nuns, the Sisters of Charity of St. Anne. Father Ruiz was invited by a Chinese priest and former prisoner, Father Lino Wong, to visit an island in China where 200 lepers had been exiled in 1986. The visit began Ruiz's ministry for lepers in the country. It is estimated that Father Ruiz worked with more than 8,000 leprosy patients living in 140 leper colonies located throughout China. His work with lepers proved so time consuming that he voluntarily handed over control of Caritas Macau to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau in 1994.In 1995, the government of Hunan invited Father Ruiz to establish a center for HIV and AIDS patients in the Chinese province. He would found other centers for AIDS patients in mainland China.On a personal level, Father Ruiz was said to be an ardent fan of Formula One, Real Madrid and Rafael Nadal.Father Luis Ruiz Suarez died in Macau on July 26, 2011, at the age of 97. His funeral was attended by dignitaries, including Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture Cheong U. He was buried at San Miguel cemetery on August 3, 2011.</description>

      <description>Zhao Ziyang (pronounced [ʈʂâu̯ tsɨ̀i̯ǎŋ]; 17 October 1919 – 17 January 2005) was a high-ranking politician in China. He was the third Premier of the People's Republic of China from 1980 to 1987, Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China from 1981 to 1982 and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China from 1987 to 1989.As a senior government official, Zhao was critical of Maoist policies and instrumental in implementing free-market reforms, first in Sichuan, subsequently nationwide. He emerged on the national scene due to support from Deng Xiaoping after the Cultural Revolution. He also sought measures to streamline China's bureaucracy and fight corruption, issues that challenged the Party's legitimacy in the 1980s. Zhao Ziyang was also an advocate of the privatization of state-owned enterprises, the separation of the Party and the state, and general market economic reforms. Many of these views were shared by then-general secretary Hu Yaobang.His economic reform policies and sympathies to student demonstrators during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 placed him at odds with some members of the party leadership, including Premier Li Peng, former President Li Xiannian and Party elder Chen Yun. Zhao also began to lose favour with paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. In the aftermath of the events, Zhao was purged politically and effectively placed under house arrest for the next 15 years.In 2005, he died from a stroke in Beijing. Because of his political fall from grace, he was not given the funeral rites generally accorded to senior Chinese officials. His unofficial autobiography was published in English and in Chinese in 2009, but the details of his life remain censored inside mainland China.</description>

He was also a strong force in educating women at a time when that was very radical for Confucian society. His efforts helped to found the McTyeire School for girls. Allen also published several newspapers and magazines as a form of both evangelism and education, which influenced many Chinese reformers of the Self-Strengthening Movement and prompted philosophical discussions comparing Christianity and Confucianism. His publications were popular among many Chinese for their attention to Western concepts of international relations, economics and the natural sciences.</description>

After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, he was a vice-chairman of the National Musical Association, president of the Beijing Guqin Society, and a department head at the Central Institute of (Folk) Music.Few recordings of his qin performance have been published, though more remain in private and institutional circulation. His playing style was unaffected but serious and elegant; he specialized in qin songs (accompanying himself vocally) and contributed several noteworthy dapu reconstructions, as well as earning the nickname \"Zha Xiaoxiang\" for his mastery of the piece Xiao Xiang Shui Yun.</description>

      <description>Watson McMillan Hayes (Chinese: 赫士; pinyin: Hèshì, born November 23, 1857 in Mercer County, Pennsylvania - died August 2, 1944 in Weifang, Shandong) was an American Presbyterian missionary and educator in China.Watson M. Hayes was the son of David Hayes (born April 6, 1832, killed in February 1865 in the American Civil War) and Margaret Jane (Watson) Hayes (born June 28, 1828). He graduated from Allegheny College and entered Western Seminary, Pittsburgh in 1879. On August 15, 1882, he was ordained and sent to China in the same year. He taught at Tengchow College and later served as its president in present-day Penglai, Shandong. In 1901, he was invited by Yuan Shikai to organize Shandong College, the forerunner of Shandong University and the second modern university in China. With the backing of Yuan Shikai, he also published Shandong's first successful newspaper (Shantung Times, Chinese: 山东时报; pinyin: Shāndōng Shíbào) and petitioned the Qing court to grant a holiday on Sundays for government schools and colleges; Shandong College was closed on Sundays right from the start. However, by the end of 1901, Hayes and six Chinese Christian teachers he had brought with him had resigned already over disagreements regarding the policy of mandatory Confucius worship for students of the college. After that, Hayes went on to teach at the Presbyterian Mission Theological College in Cheefoo (Yantai). During the Second Sino-Japanese War, W. M. Hayes, together with his wife (Margaret Young Hayes) and one of his sons (John David Hayes), was held as a prisoner in the Weihsien (Weixian) Internment Camp, a civilian assembly center operated by the Japanese on the premises of a former Presbyterian mission in the present-day town of Weifang. Hayes was forced to leave from his home for the camp in March 1943. He refused to be repatriated under the \"Prisoners Exchange Project\" organized by the International Red Cross. Suffering from diabetes, W. M. Hayes died in the camp on August 2, 1944, a bit more than one year before the camp was liberated by the Americans on August 12, 1945.W. M. Hayes' son John D. Hayes (1888–1957), continued to work as a missionary and English teacher in China until he was arrested and tried as a spy in 1951. After 10 months in jail, he was expelled from China. His trial in China was the topic of an article (\"The Brainwashing of John Hayes\", written by Frederic Sondern, Jr) published in Readers Digest (July 1955) and a television drama of the same title (teleplay by George Bruce, aired on TV Reader's Digest by ABC on 7 November 1955) in which Hayes was portrayed by the actor Vincent Price.</description>

      <description>Neil Heywood (20 October 1970 – 14 November 2011) was an English businessman who worked in China. He was associated with Bo Xilai, the former Communist Party of China Committee Secretary for Chongqing and a member of the Chinese Politburo.Heywood was found dead in his hotel room in Chongqing, and the initial official reports (which have subsequently been challenged) attributed his death to alcohol poisoning. Media reports have suggested that the former chief of police under Bo, Wang Lijun, may have had information about Heywood's death. Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu on 6 February 2012 and allegedly told US diplomats that Heywood had been poisoned, and that Bo's family was involved in corruption. The Wang Lijun incident precipitated Bo's high-profile sacking two weeks later. According to a reinvestigation by the Chinese authorities, evidence indicates that Heywood was murdered, with Gu Kailai, Bo Xilai's wife, and Zhang Xiaojun, an orderly at Bo's home, \"highly suspected,\" according to Xinhua News. On 26 July 2012, Gu Kailai was charged with the murder of Neil Heywood  and in August convicted of the crime.</description>

      <description>Luther Emmett Holt (March 4, 1855 – January 14, 1924) was an American pediatrician and author, noted for writing The Care and Feeding of Children in 1894.Born near Rochester, New York, Holt graduated from the University of Rochester in 1875. He went to medical school in the University at Buffalo and then the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, earning his M.D. in 1880. He pioneered the science of pediatrics, and became the head physician at New York's Babies Hospital in 1888. Under his leadership it became the leading pediatric hospital of its time.One of Holt's most notable accomplishments is the introduction of milk certification in New York City.  Using a grant he acquired through his connection with the Rockefeller Institute Holt surveyed the quality of milk in the tenement districts and subsequently proved that a large proportion of infant fatalities were due to excessively high bacterial counts.  He was instrumental in the creation of milk commissions and advisory boards for the city's Department of Health.Throughout his lifetime, Dr. Holt became a leader in the field of pediatrics.  He was a charter member of the American Pediatric Society and would be elected its president twice, an honor bestowed upon only one other doctor.  In 1891 he was appointed to the board of the Rockefeller Institute, under whose auspices he would eventually travel to China.  Following his development of a child welfare program adopted at the Red Cross Cannes Conference (1919), he was elected president of the Child Health Organization.As president of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality (AASPIM), Holt promoted reproduction control by society as a means of eugenics. In his 1913 presidential address he said:We must eliminate the unfit by birth not by death. The race is to be most effectively improved by preventing marriage and reproduction by the unfit, among whom we would class the diseased, the degenerate, the defective, and the criminal.He wrote The Care and Feeding of Children to great acclaim, and the text quickly became a bestseller. He also wrote Diseases of Infancy and Childhood in 1896; the book would go through 11 editions and remain the definitive text on pediatrics until 1940. Editions published after Holt's death were revised and edited by his son, Luther Emmett Holt, Jr., and Rustin McIntosh. In 1967, Holt, Jr., renewed the copyright. In 1980, Appleton/Classics of Medicine Library published a facsimile of the 1897 first edition. Holt was a professor at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons from 1901 to 1922. In 1923, despite his old age, the Rockefeller Institute called on him to lecture at Peking Union Medical College for their winter term.  Holt accepted, viewing the offer as both an opportunity to observe Chinese children for his own studies, and introduce pediatrics to the Chinese doctors.  Days before his return home, Holt suffered a heart attack and died in Peking on January 14, 1924.</description>

Many people believe the language originated in Jiangyong County. She was the last person who could natively recognize, read, sing and write Nüshu, meaning that, after her death, only researchers have these skills.When she was young, Yang learned Nüshu together with Gao Yinxian, the eldest of the seven sworn sisters who were the most authoritative speakers and writers of the female-only language, for three years. Before Yang got married, she and Gao already had become close friends. They cultivated a true and deep friendship and often corresponded with each other by Nüshu.Yang attended the National Academic Research Seminar of Nüshu in 1991 and the World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. Her works about Nüshu have been collected by Zhao Liming, a professor of Tsinghua University and they were published in 2004. The Jiangyong County offered Yang’s living expenses and employed a maid to take care of her daily life with the purpose of rescuing and preserving Nüshu.</description>

Fearing an alliance between Muhiti and General Ma Hushan, Sheng moved against Muhiti, who fled to Srinagar in India. After Muhiti reached Srinagar, he went on pilgrimage to Mecca the following year.He was said to have gone to Japan via steamboat from India and asked the Japanese emperor for aid in liberating his homeland. The emperor gave him command of a division and launched an invasion of China in 1937. Mahmut Muhiti died of a heart attack in Xi'an, China in 1945 when the Japanese surrendered in World War II.</description>

      <description>John Glasgow Kerr (1824 – 1901) was a physician and Presbyterian missionary to China with the American Presbyterian Mission.Born in Duncansville, Ohio, Kerr graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. He went to China as a medical missionary and arrived in Canton in 1854. He soon took over the Ophthalmic Hospital in Canton run by Peter Parker, the Guangzhou Boji Hospital (The Canton Hospital). He was there for 47 years and treated almost 1 million patients. He performed 480,000 surgical operations including 1300 urinary calculus. In 1870 he trained 260 Chinese medicals. Sun Yat-sen was later a student at the hospital. Kerr pioneered mental health care in China. In 1898 he opened the Canton Refuge for the Insane, the first mental hospital in China, where he served until his death. In 1887 he was the first president of the Medical Missionary Association of China. He translated 34 volumes of Materia Medica into Chinese and authored other medical books.One of his students in 1886 was Sun Yat-sen, who later became the first president of the Republic of China. Robert Elliott Speer, in the \"Monthly Missionary Survey\", wrote of him, In 1890 he was a founding member of the Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-Opium Societies.  Fellow committee members were prominent missionaries BC Atterbury MD, American Presbyterian Mission in Peking, Archdeacon Arthur Evans Moule, Church Missionary Society in Shanghai, Henry Whitney MD, American Board of Commissioners for foreign Missions in Foochow, the Rev Samuel Clarke, China Inland Mission in Kweiyang; the Rev Arthur Gostick Shorrock, English Baptist Mission in Taiyuan and the Rev Griffith John, London Mission Society in Hankow.  They resolved to continue their opposition to the opium traffic, urging Christians in China to arouse public opinion against it.  The desire of the missionaries that their ideas be carried out caused them to form “continuation committees” that were assigned tasks to assure that action would be taken on whatever matters had been approved by the conferences.   He was buried in the Protestant cemetery outside Canton, near three of his missionary colleagues, Dyer Ball, Henry V. Noyes, and Joseph C. Thomson.</description>

      <description>Su Zhu (16 February 1921 – 20 August 2008), better known by the nom de guerre Hua Guofeng, was Mao Zedong's designated successor as the paramount leader and Premier of China, also the Chairman of the Communist Party of China.A regional official in Hunan between 1949 and 1971, he became the head of the party leadership in the province during the latter stages of the Cultural Revolution. Hua was elevated to the national stage in early 1976, and was known for his loyalty to Mao. Upon Zhou Enlai's death in January 1976, Hua succeeded Zhou as Premier of the People's Republic of China and First Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China. After Mao's death, Hua took on the titles of Chairman of the Communist Party of China and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, to the surprise and dismay of Jiang Qing and the rest of the Gang of Four. Hua is the only leader to have simultaneously held the offices of party leader, premier and CMC chairman, although subsequent leaders have held the offices of party leader, CMC chairman, and president.On 6 October 1976, Hua brought the Cultural Revolution to an end and ousted the Gang of Four from political power by arranging for their arrests in Beijing. He attempted moderate reforms and reversing some of the excesses of Cultural Revolution-era policies. However, because of his insistence on continuing the Maoist line, he was himself outmaneuvered in December 1978 by Deng Xiaoping, a pragmatic reformer, who forced Hua into early retirement. As Hua faded into political obscurity, he continued to insist on the correctness of Maoist principles. He is remembered as a largely benign transitional figure in modern Chinese political history.</description>

      <description>Tan Kah Kee (21 October 1874 – 12 August 1961) was a Chinese businessman, community leader and philanthropist active in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and various Chinese cities such as Shanghai, Xiamen, and Guangzhou. He was a prominent figure in the overseas Chinese community of Southeast Asia in the 20th century, and was responsible for gathering much support from the community to aid China in major events such as the Xinhai Revolution (1911), the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition (1926–28), and the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45). Apart from donating most of his assets and earnings to aid China in those major events, Tan also helped to set up funds in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong, and contributed heavily to the establishment of several schools in Southeast Asia and Fujian, including Xiamen University.In recognition of Tan's contributions to education and society throughout his lifetime, there are places and establishments in China and Southeast Asia named after Tan or built to commemorate him, including: the Tan Kah Kee Memorial Museum in Tan's hometown in Jimei; the Tan Kah Kee Foundation, which offers postgraduate scholarships; the Tan Kah Kee MRT Station along the Downtown MRT Line in Singapore.</description>

Jeung Yim, Cheung Yim, Cheung Hung Sing, Jeong Hung Sing, Jeong Hong Sing, Zhang Yan, Zhang Hongsheng; is recognized as an important contributor to the expansion of Choy Li Fut - a Chinese martial arts system, but his role in the development is unclear as exemplified in the variety of stories reported about his life, his involvement with the development of Choy Li Fut, and his anti-Qing revolutionary activities. Few authenticated facts are known about Jeong Yim but his legacy and influence on Choy Li Fut can still be felt today.  Like all great martial artists; myths, stories, and legends, which surround them are often mistaken and confused as facts.The heated controversy surrounding Jeong Yim is in regards with his involvement with the development of Choy Li Fut. There are few written or published records verifying Jeong Yim's existence.  Most of his history has been passed down orally and subsequently any materials available on him cannot be authenticated. Various Choy Li Fut branches have differing versions of how Choy Li Fut was founded or even created.Jeong Yim's 張炎 successor Chan Ngau-Sing 陳吽盛,(1864–1926) stated that the author Nim Fut San Yen created a popular fictional story (Wǔxiá) written during the period to increase the awareness of Choy Li Fut and anti-Qing revolutionary activities. This story was called, Fut San Hung Sing Kwoon.  Chan Ngau-Sing 陳吽盛 knew the author Nim Fut San Yen personally. Such stories have no basis in historical fact. Popular Wǔxiá novels like Wan Nian Qing and the mythology of anti-Qing organizations such as the Heaven and Earth Society, were spreading wildly through China since the early 19th century.</description>

Peng Pai was one of the few Chinese intellectuals who were aware in early 1920s that peasantry and land issues caused the most critical problems for Chinese society. He believed that the success of any revolution in China must depend on the peasants as its base foundation.</description>

He is best known for leading the Qing troops in the fourth and last invasion of Burma in the Sino-Burmese War (1765–1769).Prior to his appointment as the commander-in-chief of the Burma campaign, Fuheng was chief grand  councilor to the emperor, and one of the emperor's most trusted advisers. Fuheng was one of the few senior officials that fully backed the Qianlong Emperor's decision to eliminate the Dzungars in the 1750s when most at the court thought war was too risky. His nephew Mingrui was a son-in-law of the emperor, and led the Burma campaign of 1767–1768. His son Fuk'anggan was a senior general in the Qing military.Fuheng was unsuccessful in the Burma campaign. In December 1769, he signed a truce with the Burmese, which the emperor did not accept. He died of malaria which he contracted during his three-month invasion of Burma, when he got back to Beijing.</description>

Rumors emerged stating that Qian was held on the ground by four men in security personnel uniforms while the truck was driven slowly over him. A government press conference a week later announced that Qian had died in an ordinary traffic accident, struck and killed crossing the road.An eyewitness by the name of Qian Chengwei (Chinese: 钱成委) said that he saw that four uniformed men held the victim down on the ground while the truck went on top of him. The eyewitness had since been arrested and detained by the police.Other eyewitnesses including villager Huang Diyan(Chinese: 黄迪燕), claimed she saw four uniformed men with gloves struggle with Qian and then put his body under the front tire by force.The truck's owner/driver, Fei Liangyu (Chinese: 费良玉) was detained by the police, along with other villagers who questioned the police's investigation, including Qian's daughter.His family was paid 1.05 million Yuan (US$159,000) but, as for coal miners victims for example, to decide the price of a life can be highly controversial.</description>

      <description>Abdul Majid Hasan (1380-1408 CE), also known as Maharaja Karna, allegedly was the second Sultan of Brunei. He may have ascended the Brunei throne in 1402.He was never mentioned in Salasilah Raja-Raja Brunei. A ruler from Boni named Ma-na-jih-chia-na is recorded in the Ming historical record. He sent a mission to China in 1406. The Brunei History Centre suggests that this was the Brunei sultan Abdul Majid Hasan, but there is so far no evidence for this assumption.In 1408, he went to China and died in Nanjing at the age of 28, leaving a 4-year-old prince named Xiawang (遐旺). He was buried in Nanjing. His tomb is now a tourist attraction.== Uncertainties ==The earliest historical record of the Sultans of Brunei is not clearly known due to the poor early documentation of Brunei history. In addition there has been an effort to Islamise the history, with the \"official history\" not matching up with verifiable foreign sources  The Batu Tarsilah - the genealogical record of the kings of Brunei - was not started until 1807. Therefore, much of the intepretation on history relied on earlier Chinese sources and legends. It seems that the early Sultanate of Brunei was dependent on Chinese support, and perhaps early Sultans were of Chinese origin. Furthermore the earliest Sultans may have been practising the Hindu or Buddhist religions, with early names indicating this origin. From the fact that Abdul Majid Hassan died in 1408 at the age of 28, we can surmise he was born in 1380.</description>

His reign, from 1861 to 1875, which effectively lasted through his adolescence, was largely overshadowed by the rule of his mother, Empress Dowager Cixi. Although he had little influence over state affairs, the events of his reign gave rise to what historians call the \"Tongzhi Restoration\", an unsuccessful attempt to stabilise and modernise China.</description>

He was born in the town of Xitangshi, Changshu County, near Suzhou in Jiangsu, China, and died in Beijing.  Wu served as a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, and played a prominent role in raising the guqin to professional standards as a concert instrument. His boldly passionate but also lyrically refined style was widely syncretic and incorporated influences from various qin schools as well as folk and Western music. The two most distinguished players to transmit his style and repertoire are Li Xiangting and Wu Wenguang, currently the leading guqin figures in Beijing's conservatories; Wu's broader influence extends much more widely.Wu styled himself an inheritor of the Yushan school of qin play influential during the Ming dynasty, but this association draws from his place of birth and his artistic aspirations rather than any unbroken lineage or firm stylistic affinity. His contemporary tradition is sometimes called Wu school, Yushan school, or Yushan Wu school.</description>

He occupied a number of significant military and political posts in the Kuomintang and in Sun Yat-Sen's government from the late 1910s through the 1940s. By the late 1940s he was one of the most powerful members of the Kuomintang, and in 1948, he was a successful candidate for the vice-presidency of the KMT Nationalist Government. He was also Governor of Hunan, his native province and in whose political affairs he had been active all his life. In August 1949, he peacefully surrendered to the Communists, who were rapidly advancing on Guangzhou, then the seat of the KMT government, hastening the collapse of the defense of the KMT National Revolutionary Army.  After 1949, Cheng held several important political positions in the People's Republic of China until his death in 1968. He had a child. He now has three great grandchildren: Cheng Si Boh, Cheng Si Hao and Cheng Si Hui. One of his grandchildren went to England after his death and so Cheng Si Hui's English name is Jenny Sihui Cheng.</description>

      <description>Confucius (孔夫子 Kǒng fūzǐ, literally Master Kong, /kənˈfjuːʃəs/, /kɒn-/; September 28, 551 – 479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.The philosophy of Confucius emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity. His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era only to be suppressed in favor of the Legalists during the Qin Dynasty. Following the victory of Han over Chu after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction and were further developed into a system known as Confucianism.Confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the Chinese classic texts including all of the Five Classics, but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. Aphorisms concerning his teachings were compiled in the Analects, but only many years after his death.Confucius's principles had a basis in common Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty, ancestor worship, respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives. He also recommended family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle \"Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself\", the Golden Rule.</description>

      <description>Deng Xiaoping (Simplified Chinese 邓小平, Traditional Chinese 鄧小平, pinyin dèng xiǎopíng, [tɤŋ˥˩ ɕjɑʊ˩ pʰiŋ˧˥]; 22 August 1904 – 19 February 1997), transliterated as "Tong Shau-ping", was a Chinese revolutionary and statesman. He was the paramount leader of China from 1978 until his retirement in 1992. After Mao Zedong's death, Deng led his country through far-reaching market-economy reforms. While Deng never held office as the head of state, head of government or General Secretary (that is, the leader of the Communist Party), he nonetheless was considered the "paramount leader" of the People's Republic of China from December 1978 to 1992. As the core of the second-generation leaders, Deng shared his power with several powerful older politicians commonly known as the Eight Elders.Born into a peasant background in Guang'an, Sichuan province, Deng studied and worked in France in the 1920s, where he was influenced by Marxism-Leninism. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1923. Upon his return to China he worked as a political commissar for the military in rural regions and was considered a "revolutionary veteran" of the Long March. Following the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Deng worked in Tibet and other southwestern regions to consolidate Communist control.Deng was a major supporter of Mao Zedong in the early 1950s. As the party's Secretary-General, Deng became instrumental in China's economic reconstruction following the Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s. His economic policies, however, were at odds with Mao's political ideologies. As a result, he was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution, but regained prominence in 1978 by outmaneuvering Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng.Inheriting a country fraught with social and institutional woes resulting from the Cultural Revolution and other political movements of the Mao era, Deng became the pre-eminent figure of the "second generation" of Chinese leadership. He is considered "the architect" of a new brand of socialist thinking, combining the Communist Party's socialist ideology with a pragmatic adoption of market economy practices. Deng opened China to foreign investment, the global market and limited private competition. He is generally credited with developing China into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world for over 35 years and raising the standard of living of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens.</description>

      <description>Mao Zedong (/ˈmaʊ zəˈdʊŋ, dzə-/), also transliterated as Mao Tse-tung and commonly referred to as Chairman Mao (December 26, 1893 – September 9, 1976), was a Chinese Communist revolutionary and the founding father of the People's Republic of China, which he governed as Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. His Marxist–Leninist theories, military strategies and political policies are collectively known as Marxism–Leninism–Maoism or Mao Zedong Thought.Born the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan, Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. Mao converted to Marxism–Leninism while working at Peking University and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), after Japan's defeat China's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the Nationalists who withdrew to Taiwan.On October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a single-party state controlled by the CPC. In the following years Mao solidified his control through land reform campaigns against landlords, and perceived enemies of the state he termed as "counter-revolutionaries". In 1957 he launched a campaign known as the Great Leap Forward that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from an agrarian economy to an industrial one, which led to a widespread famine whose death toll is estimated at between 18 and 45 million. In 1966, he initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a program to remove "counter-revolutionary" elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao's personality cult.In 1972, Mao welcomed US president Richard Nixon in Beijing, signalling a policy of opening China, which was furthered under Deng Xiaoping's rule in China.A controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important individuals in modern world history. Supporters credit him with driving imperialism out of China, modernising China and building it into a world power, promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, and increasing life expectancy as China's population grew from around 550 to over 900 million during the period of his leadership. He is also known as a theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary. In contrast, critics consider him a dictator who severely damaged traditional Chinese culture, as well as a perpetrator of systematic human rights abuses who was responsible for an estimated 40 to 70 million deaths through starvation, forced labour and executions, ranking his tenure as the top incidence of democide in human history.</description>

      <description>Alberico (Alberic) Crescitelli (1863–1900) was an Italian Catholic priest and missionary to China. Born in Italy on 30 June 1863, Father Alberico Crescitelli entered the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions in 1880 and was ordained a priest on 4 June 1887. The following year he went to China and began work in southern Shaanxi.Crescitelli was believed to have been killed in the Boxer Rebellion. Crescitelli's confreres, who had known him well and for many years, started his beatification cause in 1908, only eight years after his death. The testimony provided by the confreres was unanimous about the holiness of Crescitelli's life.At the Vatican, in St. Peter's Basilica on 18 February 1951, Pope Pius XII declared Alberico Crescitelli \"blessed.\" The Pope's speech was memorable especially for the passage in which he described Father Alberico's martyrdom:Pope John Paul II included him in the list of 120 Martyr Saints of China canonized in St. Peter's Square on October 1, 2000.This large group canonisation was bitterly opposed in China itself, with Bishop Fu Tieshan, the leader of the state-run Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association describing it as \"intolerable\". A statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry alleged that \"some of those canonised by the Vatican this time perpetrated outrages such as raping or looting in China and committed unforgivable crimes against the Chinese people.\" A further statement from China's State Administration of Religious Affairs singled out Alberico Crescitelli for special comment, alleging that he had been \"notorious for taking the 'right of the first night' of each bride under his diocese.\" The Catholic Church's Holy Spirit Study Centre in Hong Kong has described the accusations as baseless.In his homily at the canonisation ceremony on 1 October 2000, Pope John Paul II made a statement asking for forgiveness for any past wrongs by the missionaries to China: \"There are those who with a partial and not very objective reading of history see only limits and errors in their action. If they happened - is there any man exempt from defects? - we ask for forgiveness.\"His name in Chinese was 郭锡德 (Guo Xi-de).</description>

      <description>Bai Juyi (also Bo Juyi or Po Chu-i; Chinese: 白居易; pinyin: Bai Juyi; 772–846) was a renowned Chinese poet and Tang Dynasty government official. Many of his poems concern his career or observations made about everyday life, including as governor of three different provinces. Burton Watson says of Bai Juyi: \"he worked to develop a style that was simple and easy to understand, and posterity has requited his efforts by making him one of the most well-loved and widely read of all Chinese poets, both in his native land and in the other countries of the East that participate in the appreciation of Chinese culture. He is also, thanks to the translations and biographical studies by Arthur Waley, one of the most accessible to English readers\".  Bai was also influential in the historical development of Japanese literature. His younger brother Bai Xingjian was a short story writer.</description>

      <description>Zhang Qian (Chinese: 張騫; d. 113 BC) was a Chinese official and diplomat who served as an imperial envoy to the world outside of China in the 2nd century BC, during the time of the Han dynasty. He was the first official diplomat to bring back reliable information about Central Asia to the Chinese imperial court, then under Emperor Wu of Han, and played an important pioneering role in the Chinese colonization and conquest of the region now known as Xinjiang.Today Zhang Qian's travels are associated with the major route of transcontinental trade, the Silk Road. In essence, his missions opened up to China the many kingdoms and products of a part of the world then unknown to the Chinese. Zhang Qian's accounts of his explorations of Central Asia are detailed in the Early Han historical chronicles, Records of the Grand Historian, compiled by Sima Qian in the 1st century BC. The Central Asian sections of the Silk Road routes were expanded around 114 BC largely through the missions and explorations of Zhang Qian. Today Zhang Qian is considered a national hero and revered for the key role he played in opening China to the world of commercial trade.</description>

She is known to be the first female architect in modern China and her husband the famed \"Father of Modern Chinese Architecture\" Liang Sicheng, both of whom worked as founders and faculty in the newly formed Architecture Department of Northeastern University in 1928 and, after 1949, as professors in Tsinghua University in Beijing. Liang and Lin began restoration work on cultural heritage sites of China in the post-imperial Republican Era of China; a passion which she would pursue to the end of her life. The American artist Maya Lin is her niece.</description>

He felt it could provide a guide for the country during its tumultuous period following the May Fourth Movement in 1919. He felt that national survival was predicated on a sense of community, which in turn could only come from trusting commitments from the people involved. He believed that the most urgent task for the educated elite in China was to raise the cultural awareness and sensitivity of the people that the clash between the West and China was not solely a clash of economic strength and military might, but also a conflict between basic human values. While he led a fairly secluded life throughout his career as a teacher and his association with the academic community did not begin until he was in his late thirties, his views have influenced scholars to this day.</description>

He opposed the formation of state-sanctioned Christian churches in China (Three-Self Patriotic Movement) and supported the Legion of Mary, an association of Catholic laity that was viewed as reactionary organization by the communists. As a consequence, Jarre was arrested by the Chinese authorities on July 25, 1951 and from October 17, 1951 onwards he was imprisoned in Jinan.Jarre was subjected to conditions of poor sanitation, nutrition, isolation, repeated interrogation, as well as other forms of abuse. He died on March 8, 1952 in the St. Josephs Hospital of Jinan. Members of his diocese buried Jarre's body wrapped in the red clothes of a martyr, but the authorities exhumed his body with the intent to rebury him in a black prisoner's uniform. In the end, a compromise was reached and Jarre's body was buried in white clothes. His grave is located in the Lin Jia Zhuang (Chinese: 林家庄村; pinyin: Línjiā Zhuāngcūn) Catholic cemetery to the southeast of Jinan.</description>

      <description>Margaret Emma Barber or M. E. Barber (1866–1930; Chinese: 和受恩; Pinyin: Hé Shòuēn; Foochow Romanized: Huò Sêu-ŏng), was a British missionary in China.  She was born in 1866 in Peasenhall, Suffolk, England, the daughter of Louis (a wheelwright) and Martha (née Gibbs) Barber. The family moved to 59 St Martins Lane Norwich around 1876 and established a Carriage Manufacturing business. The family home in Norwich (see georgeplunkett.co.uk for a view of 59 St Martins Lane) was opposite St Martins Parish church which was intensly evangelical in the 1880 - 90s and must have had an influence on the Barber family. During the course of her life, she lived in China twice to preach the Christian gospel.  She left her home and traveled in a lonely way thousands of miles.  Barber, who initially went to China as an Anglican, became an independent missionary with informal ties to the Plymouth Brethren.  She is best known for her influence on Watchman Nee (Nee Tuo-Sheng).Along the south China coast (in Foochow), she and others regularly taught a Bible class at \"White Teeth Rock\".  There she had contact with Nee who was studying at Anglican Trinity College.  Barber referred him to books by J. N. Darby, Madam Jeanne Guyon, Jessie Penn-Lewis, D. M. Panton, T. Austin Sparks, and of others, which had been of help to her.  She also influenced others Chinese Christian leaders, including Leland Wang who later formed the Chinese Foreign Missionary Union.</description>

He studied extensively with the great Baguazhang master Ma Gui (1851-1941), and is considered to be one of only two modern masters (the other being Wang Peisheng) to have successfully passed on Ma Gui's unique lineage to current generations.  According to Liu Wanchuan, the Baguazhang style that Ma Gui taught him using \"low basin, small steps, and particularly heavy power and strength,\" and for those who practice it regularly \"at the very least it will add ten or twenty years to your life.\"For Baguazhang practitioners, \"the most striking characteristic of Ma Gui Baguazhang is the slow and stable circle-walking that develops lower leg strength, qi, blood flow, and whole body power. The body develops to resemble Dong Haichuan and Ma Gui – a thick trunk and back with well developed dantian, firm wrists and ankles, powerful legs and arms, a rosy complexion, and calm expression.\"The Ma Gui Baguazhang lineage passed down through Liu Wanchuan is now actively taught around the world in China, Japan, Australia, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States by current Ma Gui Baguazhang lineage holder Li Baohua.</description>

      <description>Zhou Enlai (simplified Chinese: 周恩来; traditional Chinese: 周恩來; pinyin: Zhōu Ēnlái; Wade–Giles: Chou En-lai) IPA: [ʈʂə́ʊ ə́nlǎɪ] (5 March 1898 – 8 January 1976) was the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, serving from October 1949 until his death in January 1976. Zhou served under Mao Zedong and was instrumental in consolidating the control of the Communist Party's rise to power, forming foreign policy, and developing the Chinese economy.A skilled and able diplomat, Zhou served as the Chinese foreign minister from 1949 to 1958. Advocating peaceful coexistence with the West after the stalemated Korean War, he participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference, the 1955 Bandung Conference, and helped orchestrate Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. He helped devise policies regarding the bitter disputes with the U.S., Taiwan, the Soviet Union (after 1960), India and Vietnam.Zhou survived the purges of other top officials during the Cultural Revolution. With Mao dedicating most of his later years to political struggle and ideological work, Zhou was the main driving force behind the affairs of state during much of the Cultural Revolution. His attempts at mitigating the Red Guards' damage and his efforts to protect others from their wrath made him immensely popular in the Cultural Revolution's later stages.As Mao Zedong's health began to decline in 1971 and 1972, Zhou and the Gang of Four struggled internally over leadership of China. Zhou's health was also failing, however, and he died eight months before Mao on 8 January 1976. The massive public outpouring of grief in Beijing turned to anger towards the Gang of Four, leading to the Tiananmen Incident. Although succeeded by Hua Guofeng, it was Deng Xiaoping, Zhou's ally, who was able to outmaneuver the Gang of Four politically and eventually take Mao's place as Paramount leader by 1978.</description>

He died in office before he could complete his terms on the Standing Committee and as Vice-Premier.An electrical engineer by trade, Huang was a close confidante of party leader and President Jiang Zemin, to whom he owed his rise to power. He served as Mayor of Shanghai between 1991 and 1994, then Communist Party Secretary of the metropolis between 1994 and 2002. Huang's career in Shanghai and his family's alleged involvement in several corruption cases in the city generated controversy. After 2002, Huang emerged as one of the least popular and most partisan members of China's top leadership, and was named by observers as a "core member" of the Shanghai clique.</description>

Although Hu was successful in the \"lighting attack\" operation to sack Yan'an, he was unable to capture or kill the CCP leadership.  Hu was his personal secretary in 1946-1947, Xiong Xianghui, had tipped off the CCP leadership in March, two weeks prior to the Nationalist assault.  Xiong's warning gave the CCP leadership enough time to relocate to Zhangjiakou.  Xiong had also provided the CCP with Hu's battle plans and elements of conversations he had overheard with Nationalist leader Jiang Jieshi, which would cause immense damage to Hu's forces thereafter.After the Chinese Civil War, Xiong studied abroad in the United States.  Xiong had a long diplomatic career after returning to China, ultimately serving in key posts and alongside Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, with whom he had a lifelong friendship.  Xiong would serve as Zhou's personal assistant during the meetings with Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon.  He advocated \"playing the America card\" against the USSR during the Sino-Soviet tensions of the 1970s.  Xiong finished his career as the PRC's first Ambassador to Mexico, after Mexico followed the United Nations lead in switching recognition from the Republic of China] on Taiwan to the Communist People's Republic of China on the mainland.Xiong died of cancer in Beijing three years after his wife, Chen Xiaohua, with whom he had two children.</description>

Yamanaka died of dysentary in Manchuria after being drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army. He is the uncle of the Japanese film director Tai Kato, who once penned a book about Yamanaka, Eiga kantoku Yamanaka Sadao.Only three of his films survive in nearly complete form. While long considered a master filmmaker in his native Japan, interest in Yamanaka's work redeveloped after the restoration and Japanese DVD release of the three surviving films. His most internationally discussed film, Humanity and Paper Balloons (1937), was given its first non-Japanese DVD release in the UK as a Masters of Cinema release.</description>

She had also broken Robert Wadlow's previous record of tallest 17-year-old ever. In the year between Don Koehler's death and her own, she surpassed fellow \"eight-footers\" Gabriel Estêvão Monjane and Suleiman Ali Nashnush.  That Zeng's growth patterns mirrored those of Robert Wadlow is shown in the table below.She was the second ever woman in the history to become the Tallest Recognized person in the world, Jane Bunford was the first.</description>

      <description>Lü Zhengcao (simplified Chinese: 吕正操; traditional Chinese: 呂正操; pinyin: Lǚ Zhèngcāo) (4 January 1904– 13 October 2009) was a Chinese military officer. He was one of the original Shang Jiang of the People's Liberation Army.Lü was born in Haicheng, in the province of Liaoning. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1937. He fought in China's war against Japan 1937–1945 as well as the civil war against the Kuomintang 1945–1949.Before he joined the Communists, Lü worked as an assistant to the Kuomintang general, Zhang Xueliang. It was in this role that he was a witness to the Xi'an Incident, whereby Zhang and his fellow general, Yang Hucheng, forced the then-Chinese leader, Chiang Kai-shek to suspend the civil war with the Communists in 1936 in order and join forces against the Japanese.Lü resigned from the Kuomintang in 1937 and joined the Communist Party. He then commanded a military force that fought the Japanese army in northern China.Following the Communist victory of 1949, Lü served as a senior military leader of the PRC. He was appointed as a Shang Jiang (general) in 1955 following the re-establishment of rank.In 1985, to support the return of the critically endangered Père David's deer to China, Lü Zhengcao helped found and chair the China Milu Foundation, now known as the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.On 13 October 2009, Lü died in Beijing at the age of 104 by Western age reckoning, or at the age of 105 by the traditional age system. At the time of his death, he was the last survivor of the original generals of the People's Liberation Army.</description>

There he met and married his wife, Isabel, a teacher and social activist.  The couple stayed in China after 1949 to teach English.In 1959, the Crooks published Revolution in a Chinese Village, Ten Mile Inn and in 1966 came The First Years of Yangyi Commune. The British Sinologist Delia Davin wrote that through that \"classic study\" and other writings and talks, the Crooks \"provided a positive picture of China to the outside world at a time when cold war simplifications were the norm.\" The Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist) called Revolution a \"seminal work, which has been bringing the achievements and challenges of the Chinese agrarian revolution to life for English-speaking readers since 1959.\" Crook died at 90 after spending his last five decades in China, his political beliefs largely unshaken despite five years' imprisonment during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76).</description>

A senior student of Yang Chengfu (1883–1936), he originally studied Wu (Hao)-style t'ai chi ch'uan as a young man. Tung also studied with Chengfu's older brother Yang Shao-hou (1862–1930) and was the founder of Tung Tai Chi. In Shao-hou's classes he was an older classmate of the Wu-style's Wu Kung-i (1900–1970) and Wu Kung-tsao (1902–1983), and the men remained close colleagues in later years. Following the trend of many famous t'ai chi masters who moved south during the War years, Tung moved to Hong Kong in 1949 and taught Yang style there. The Tung style as it eventually developed included training features researched by Tung Ying-chieh, both with Yang Chengfu and independently.He wrote a book called \"T'ai chi ch'uan Explained\" or \"Principles of T'ai chi ch'uan\" (T'ai chi ch'uan Shih I, 太極拳釋義) which has recently been translated from Chinese into English. First published in 1948, it has been reprinted (notably in Hong Kong in 1975) and updated continuously since its first publication.Tung Ying-chieh was followed by son Tung Huling (董虎岭) who is followed by Tung Kai Ying and Dong Zeng Chen. The members of the Tung family teach t'ai chi ch'uan in Asia, Hawaii, North America and Europe.</description>

      <description>Zhang Heng (Chinese: t 張衡, s 张衡, p; AD 78–139), formerly romanized as Chang Hêng, was a Han Chinese polymath from Nanyang who lived during the Han dynasty. Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, scientist, engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar.Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. His uncompromising stance on historical and calendrical issues led to his becoming a controversial figure, preventing him from rising to the status of Grand Historian. His political rivalry with the palace eunuchs during the reign of Emperor Shun (r. 125–144) led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of Hejian in Hebei. Zhang returned home to Nanyang for a short time, before being recalled to serve in the capital once more in 138. He died there a year later, in 139.Zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first water-powered armillary sphere to assist astronomical observation; improved the inflow water clock by adding another tank; and invented the world's first seismometer, which discerned the cardinal direction of an earthquake 500 km (310 mi) away. He improved previous Chinese calculations for pi. In addition to documenting about 2,500 stars in his extensive star catalog, Zhang also posited theories about the Moon and its relationship to the Sun: specifically, he discussed the Moon's sphericity, its illumination by reflected sunlight on one side and the hidden nature of the other, and the nature of solar and lunar eclipses. His fu (rhapsody) and shi poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity; some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the Greco-Roman Ptolemy (AD 86–161).</description>

      <description>Liang Congjie (Chinese: 梁从诫; 4 August 1932 – 28 October 2010) was a Chinese historian best known for his work as an environmental activist who established the Friends of Nature in 1994 as the first environmental non-governmental organization to be officially recognized by the government of the People's Republic of China.Liang's father, architect Liang Sicheng, had led attempts to prevent the destruction of the walls surrounding Beijing with the land to be used for the construction of highways. His grandfather Liang Qichao spent 14 years in exile in Japan after he advocated on behalf of turning the Qing Dynasty into a constitutional monarchy. His ancestry came to haunt him during the Maoist Cultural Revolution when he was purged for his being the \"grandson of China's biggest royalist\". Liang was ultimately able to attend Peking University.Having learned about the activities of Greenpeace, Liang and three of his colleagues at the Academy for Chinese Culture came to agreement that a corresponding organization was required in China to address growing environmental concerns in that country. The group that they formed, Friends of Nature, eschewed Greenpeace's more confrontational techniques, choosing to develop grassroots concern about nature through fostering environmental awareness in schools and establishing the nation's first birdwatching group. The organization worked with the Chinese government to ensure enforcement of existing environmental law, including efforts to protect a Tibetan antelope which were on the path to extinction and videotaping the cutting stands of old-growth forest in Western China that led to a 1999 order by Zhu Rongji prohibiting cutting down such trees.Environmentalist Ma Jun described Liang as having \"incubated the first generation of environmentalists in China\" and described how he worked in conjunction with the government on a \"constructively critical\" basis to build support for protecting the environment. Friends of Nature's Li Bo credited him with \"promoting ordinary Chinese's participation in supervising pollution problems and protecting the environment\". Liang was recognized in 2000 with the Ramon Magsaysay Award, which recognizes Asian contributions to public service, noting that he was able to push environmental issues while having \"avoided the pitfall of alienating government\".Liang died at the age of 78 on October 28, 2010, due to a lung infection while at a hospital in Beijing. He was survived by his wife, a daughter and a son.</description>

      <description>Shi Tiesheng (史铁生) (1951 – December 31, 2010) was a Chinese novelist, known for his story which was the basis of the film Life on a String. The China Daily stated regarding his essay about the park near where he lived, \"Many critics have considered I and the Temple of Earth (zh:我与地坛) as one of the best Chinese prose essays of the 20th century.\"Shi was born in Beijing, and graduated from Tsinghua University High School.In 1969 he was a \"sent-down youth\" or urban youth sent to a rural area of Shaanxi as part of the Down to the Countryside Movement of the Cultural Revolution. There he was paralyzed in an accident at the age of 21, and was sent back to Beijing.Shi was published for the first time in 1979. His 1983 short story \"Wo de yaoyuan de qingping wan\" (\"My Faraway Clear Peace River\") won the National Excellent Short Story Prize. The story is about a zhiqing and an old man of the village, and takes the view that the peasants suffer more over the long term than the urban youth sent from the city.  A sequel, \"A Story of Rustication\" (\"Chadui de gushi\") was published in 1986.In 1980 director Tian Zhuangzhuang based a short film called Our Corner on a story by Shi; it was the first film by a filmmaker of China's Fifth Generation Cinema.Shi's 1985 novella \"Like a Banjo String\" (命若琴弦) about a pair of blind musicians, was the basis of the 1991 film Life on a String directed by Chen Kaige.His collections of short stories include My Faraway Clear Peace River (Wo de yaoyuan de qingping wan) (1985) and Sunday (Libairi) (1988).A collection of English-language translations of his short stories was published in 1991 as Strings of Life.In 1996 his novel Notes on Principles (务虚笔记) was published.In selecting it as a notable work of Chinese literature since 1949 which could qualify as an overlooked classic, Professor Shelley W. Chan of Wittenberg University said Notes on Principles was similar to but better than Soul Mountain by Nobel Prize-winner Gao Xingjian.In 1998 his kidneys began to fail and he subsequently required dialysis three timesweekly.He received the Lao She Literature Prize for Fragments Written at the Hiatuses of Sickness (病隙碎笔)(2002).In 2006 he published My Sojourn in Ding Yi (我的丁一之旅), about an immortal spirit that inhabits the bodies of a succession of people, including Adam, Shi Tiesheng himself, and the book's hero, Ding Yi.On the morning of December 31, 2010, Shi died of cerebral hemorrhage.</description>

The name he used while in the United States was Hsue-Shen Tsien or H.S. Tsien.During the 1940s Qian was one of the founders of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. During the Second Red Scare of the 1950s, the United States government accused Qian of having communist sympathies, and he was stripped of his security clearance in 1950. Qian then decided to return to China, but instead was detained at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. After spending 5 years under virtual house arrest, Qian was released in 1955, in exchange for the repatriation of American pilots captured during the Korean War. Notified by U.S. authorities that he was free to go, Qian immediately arranged his departure, leaving for China in September 1955, on the passenger liner SS President Cleveland of American President Lines, via Hong Kong. He returned to lead the Chinese rocket program, and became known as the \"Father of Chinese Rocketry\" (or \"King of Rocketry\").He was the cousin of the mechanical engineer Hsue-Chu Tsien, and his nephew is the 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry winner Roger Y. Tsien. Asteroid 3763 Qianxuesen and the ill-fated space ship Tsien in the science fiction novel 2010: Odyssey Two are named after him.</description>

      <description>An Dehai (Chinese: 安德海; pinyin: Ān Déhǎi; Wade–Giles: An Te-hai, 1844 – 12 September 1869) was a palace eunuch at the imperial court of the Qing dynasty. In the 1860s, he became the confidant of Empress Dowager Cixi and was subsequently executed as part of a power struggle between the empress dowager and Prince Gong.In 1869, Empress Dowager Cixi sent An on a mission to the Imperial Textile Factory in Nanjing. On this trip, An travelled on the Grand Canal with a conspicuous display of imperial authority. This was an open violation of palace rules, which prohibited palace eunuchs from leaving the capital without authorisation on the penalty of death, so as to prevent eunuchs from gaining too much power. When An and his entourage reached Shandong Province, the governor Ding Baozhen reported his behaviour back to the Forbidden City. Led by Prince Gong, who disliked An, the Grand Council ordered the execution of the eunuch. Empress Dowager Ci'an seemed to have supported the decision whereas Empress Dowager Cixi, who favoured An, did not intervene on the eunuch's behalf. According to one explanation, Empress Dowager Cixi was attending a performance of Beijing opera at the time that the decision was taken and had requested not to be disturbed. As a result, An and six other eunuchs in his entourage were beheaded near the Ximizhi Spring in a Guandi Temple in Jinan. The other members of An's group were made slaves and banished to Heilongjiang in the far northeastern corner of the Qing Empire. An's execution was likely part of a broader power struggle between Empress Dowager Cixi and Prince Gong.</description>

      <description>Chung On Siew (simplified Chinese: 郑安寿, traditional Chinese: 鄭安壽, pinyin: Zhèng Ānshòu, 1851 - 25 December 1907) was a low profile mainland Chinese capitalist, industrialist, inventor, investor, philanthropist and real estate developer known for his extensive travels and scholarship. He was conferred upon the title Justice of the Peace by the Queen of England, Alexandrina Victoria, for his contributions in charity and education to the British Commonwealth during the late eighteenth-century. His anglicised and transliterated surname Chung, derived from the surname Zheng, is also anglicised and transliterated as Chang or Zhang.Based on historical records, he was the descendant, precisely the twenty fourth generation, of an aristocratic family from Xinyang, Henan Province, China. This scholar-gentry family dominated the Zhuangyuan title of the prestigious Chinese imperial examination for over a thousand years. Despite being subjugated during the Tang Dynasty, as descendants of royalty from the Zheng (state), they became the most powerful and richest people as well as top scholars recorded in ancient Chinese history. During the Qing Dynasty, as a result of their family ties with the ruling Aixinjueluo family through marriages as well as their ranks in imperial court, they were assigned to carry out imperial edict in Canton, modern day Guangzhou, China.Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was invited by the British to develop British Malaya. He was known as a wise investor as well as the inventor of the hydraulic mining method. One of his largest tin mines employed over 400 men. His tin mines were managed by European engineer, A. Hamilton.  He has a street named after him in the tin mining town of Ipoh, Perak. The street was selected by Oscar winning Taiwanese Director Ang Lee as a setting for one of his award winning movies. An international hotel chain, ibis Styles, was constructed along the street after demolishment of his pre war shophouses in 2013.According to a prolific British writer, Arnold Wright, he was one of the biggest owner with many rubber plantations and tin mines in South East Asia. Based on the Singapore Straits Times published on 4 June 1908, he acquired many other properties in China and Hong Kong. He retired back to China in 1905 and resided in China until his death in 1907. His descendants now reside in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, United Kingdom and United States of America while some remain in China.</description>

He married Li Bozhao in 1929, one of the few women to participate in the Long March, as did Yang.Yang attended university in Shanghai before studying Marxist theory in Moscow, making him one of the best educated leaders of the early Communist Party of China. Yang returned to China as one of the 28 Bolsheviks and originally supported the early communist leader Zhang Guotao, but switched allegiance to Mao's faction during the Long March. He served as a political commissar during the Chinese Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese War. After the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Yang held a number of political positions, eventually becoming a member of the powerful Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He was purged when the Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966, and was not recalled until 1978, after Deng Xiaoping rose to power. After his return to power, Yang became one of China's Eight Elders. Yang promoted economic reform but opposed political liberalization, a position which Deng eventually came to identify with. Yang reached the height of his political career after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, but his organized opposition to Jiang Zemin's leadership led Deng to force Yang to retire.</description>

Like his father, the Kangxi Emperor, Yongzheng used military force to preserve the dynasty's position. His reign was known for being despotic, efficient, and vigorous.Although Yongzheng's reign was much shorter than that of both his father (the Kangxi Emperor) and his son (the Qianlong Emperor), Yongzheng continued an era of peace and prosperity. He cracked down on corruption and reformed the financial administration. His reign saw the formulation of the Grand Council, an institution which had an enormous impact on the future of the Qing dynasty.</description>

      <description>Peng Dehuai (Peng Te-huai; simplified Chinese: 彭德怀; traditional Chinese: 彭德懷; pinyin: Péng Déhuái; Wade–Giles: P'eng2 Te2-huai2) (October 24, 1898 – November 29, 1974) was a prominent Chinese Communist military leader, and served as China's Defense Minister from 1954 to 1959. Peng was born into a poor peasant family, and received several years of primary education before his family's poverty forced him to suspend his education at the age of ten, and to work for several years as a manual laborer. When he was sixteen, Peng became a professional soldier. Over the next ten years Peng served in the armies of several Hunan-based warlord armies, raising himself from the rank of private second class to major. In 1926 Peng's forces joined the Kuomintang, and Peng was first introduced to communism. Peng participated in the Northern Expedition, and supported Wang Jingwei's attempt to form a left-leaning Kuomintang government based in Wuhan. After Wang was defeated, Peng briefly rejoined Chiang Kai-shek's forces before joining the Chinese Communist Party, allying himself with Mao Zedong and Zhu De.Peng was one of the most senior generals who defended the Jiangxi Soviet from Chiang's attempts to capture it, and his successes were rivaled only by Lin Biao. Peng participated in the Long March, and supported Mao Zedong at the Zunyi Conference, which was critical to Mao's rise to power. During the 1937–1945 Second Sino-Japanese War, Peng was one of the strongest supporters of pursuing a ceasefire with the Kuomintang in order to concentrate China's collective resources on resisting the Japanese Empire. Peng was the senior commander in the combined Kuomintang-Communist efforts to resist the Japanese occupation of Shanxi in 1937; and, by 1938, was in command of 2/3 of the Eighth Route Army. In 1940, Peng conducted the Hundred Regiments Offensive, a massive Communist effort to disrupt Japanese logistical networks across northern China. The Hundred Regiments Offensive was modestly successful, but political disputes within the Communist Party led to Peng being recalled to Yan'an, and he spent the rest of the war without an active command. After the Japanese surrendered, in 1945, Peng was given command of Communist forces in Northwest China. He was the most senior commander responsible for defending the Communist leadership in Shaanxi from Kuomintang forces, saving Mao from being captured at least once. Peng eventually defeated the Kuomintang in Northwest China, captured huge amounts of military supplies, and actively incorporated the huge area, including Xinjiang, into the People's Republic of China.Peng was one of the few senior military leaders who supported Mao's suggestions to involve China directly in the 1950–1953 Korean War, and he served as the direct commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the first half of the war (though Mao and Zhou Enlai were technically more senior). Peng's experiences in the Korean War convinced him that the Chinese military had to become more professional, organized, and well-equipped in order to prepare itself for the conditions of modern technical warfare. Because the Soviet Union was the only communist country then equipped with a fully modern, professional army, Peng attempted to reform China's military on the Soviet model over the next several years, making the army less political and more professional (contrary to the political goals of Mao). Peng resisted Mao's attempts to develop a personality cult throughout the 1950s; and, when Mao's economic policies associated with the Great Leap Forward caused a nationwide famine, Peng became critical of Mao's leadership. The rivalry between Peng and Mao culminated in an open confrontation between the two at the 1959 Lushan Conference. Mao won this confrontation, labeled Peng as a leader of an \"anti-Party clique\", and purged Peng from all influential positions for the rest of his life.Peng lived in virtual obscurity until 1965, when the reformers Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping supported Peng's limited return to government, developing military industries in Southwest China. In 1966, following the advent of the Cultural Revolution, Peng was arrested by Red Guards. From 1966–1970, radical factions within the Communist Party, led by Lin Biao and Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, singled out Peng for national persecution, and Peng was publicly humiliated in numerous large-scale struggle sessions and subjected to physical and psychological torture in organized efforts to force Peng to confess his \"crimes\" against Mao Zedong and the Communist Party. In 1970 Peng was formally tried and sentenced to life imprisonment, and he died in prison in 1974. After Mao died in 1976, Peng's old ally, Deng Xiaoping, emerged as China's paramount leader. Deng led an effort to formally rehabilitate people who had been unjustly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, and Peng was one of the first leaders to be posthumously rehabilitated, in 1978. In modern China, Peng is considered one of the most successful and highly respected generals in the history of the early Chinese Communist Party.</description>

She was the beloved consort of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang during his later years.During the An Lushan Rebellion, as Emperor Xuanzong and his cortege were fleeing from the capital Chang'an to Chengdu, the emperor's guards demanded that he put Yang to death because they blamed the rebellion on her cousin Yang Guozhong and the rest of her family. The emperor capitulated and reluctantly ordered his attendant Gao Lishi to strangle Yang to death.</description>

In 1904, Berntsen and his wife Magna was able to preach along with several other independent Norwegian missionaries in a mission station in Damingfu of Zhili Province. Influenced by the 1906 Azusa Street Revival, he later founded the Apostolic Faith Mission in China (later amalgamated with the Assemblies of God) with a group of American missionaries associated with the Pentecostal movement. His evangelism had a profound influence on the early co-workers of the True Jesus Church, namely Zhang Lingsheng and Paul Wei, and he is regarded as one of the early missionary progenitors of Pentecostalism in China.</description>

      <description>Dai Wangshu (Chinese: 戴望舒; pinyin: Dài Wàngshū) (also Tai Wang-shu or Tai Van-chou) (March 5, 1905–February 28, 1950) was a Chinese poet, essayist and translator active from the late 1920s to the end of the 1940s. A native of Hangzhou, Zhejiang, he graduated from the Aurora University, Shanghai in 1926, majoring in French.He was closely associated with the Shanghai Modernist school, also known as New Sensibility or New Sensation School, a name inspired by the Japanese modernist writer Riichi Yokomitsu. Other members of the group were Mu Shiying, Liu Na'ou, Shi Zhecun, and Du Heng, whose Third Category thesis (that a writer could be on the left but remain independent) Dai defended against the hard line taken by the May Fourth Movement veteran Lu Xun.Between 1932 and 1935 Dai studied in France at the University of Lyon's Institut Franco-chinois and published several poems in French. He collaborated in translating modern Chinese literature with French writer and academic Étiemble, and met contemporary French poets such as Jules Supervielle.During the Sino-Japanese War, Dai worked in Hong Kong as a newspaper editor. He was arrested and put into jail for several months during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. During this period Dai developed acute asthma. After the war, he returned to Shanghai and then Beijing, and died there having accidentally overdosed on the ephedrine he took to control his asthma.His early poetry has numerous intertextual links with the French Neo-symbolist poetry of Paul Fort and, in particular, Francis Jammes. Yet many references to pre-modern Tang Chinese lyric texts can also be discerned in his early poems. Some scholars have assumed that this \"symbolist influence\" came from more well-known French poets such as Verlaine and Baudelaire. However, while Dai Wangshu and other poets in China knew Verlaine's work through the versions of the English symbolist Ernest Dowson, there is no evidence of an early close inter-textual relationship with Baudelaire. In the late 1940s, when he had returned from Europe and shifted from Neo-symbolism to a more generally modernist style (that drew also on Daoist texts), Dai translated Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal into Chinese. Dai, who had visited Spain before the Spanish Civil War, was the first to translate the poetry of Federico García Lorca into Chinese.</description>

      <description>Norodom Sihanouk (Khmer: នរោត្តម សីហនុ; 31 October 1922 – 15 October 2012) was the King of Cambodia from 1941 to 1955 and again from 1993 to 2004. Sihanouk ascended to the throne in 1941 and after the Second World War, he campaigned for the independence of Cambodia from French rule. Cambodia subsequently became an independent state in 1953. In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated the throne in favour of his father Norodom Suramarit, and went on to form the Sangkum, a political organisation. Sihanouk led the Sangkum to win the 1955 general elections, and became the Prime Minister of Cambodia. When Suramarit died in 1960, Sihanouk introduced a constitutional amendment which made him the Head of State of Cambodia, a position which he held until his overthrow in 1970 by Lon Nol and Sisowath Sirik Matak. A new government, the Khmer Republic, was instituted after Sihanouk's ouster as the Head of State.Sihanouk fled to China and North Korea and went on to form a government in exile, known as the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea (GRUNK) as well as a resistance movement, the National United Front of Kampuchea. As the leader of GRUNK, Sihanouk lent his support to the Khmer Rouge which led to their victory against the Khmer Republic in April 1975. Sihanouk subsequently returned to Cambodia and made the figurehead Head of State of Democratic Kampuchea by the Khmer Rouge. In 1976, Sihanouk resigned from his position which led to him being placed under house arrest until 1979 when Vietnamese forces overthrew the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk went into exile again, and in 1981 he formed FUNCINPEC, a resistance front. The following year in 1982, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) was formed which brought together the three anti-Vietnamese resistance factions consisting of FUNCINPEC, Khmer Rouge and Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), and Sihanouk was appointed as the President of the CGDK.In the late 1980s, informal talks were carried out to end hostilities between the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) and resistance factions under the CGDK. A transitional body to oversee Cambodian affairs, the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC) was formed in 1990 which saw Sihanouk appointed as its President. The following year in 1991, peace accords were signed which led to the creation of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The UNTAC organised general elections in 1993, which led to the formation of a coalition government jointly led by his son Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen. Sihanouk was reinstated as the Head of State of Cambodia in June 1993. When a permanent constitution was promolugated in September 1993, Sihanouk was made the King of Cambodia for a second time. In 2004, Sihanouk abdicated again in favour of another son, Norodom Sihamoni who succeeded him as king. He subsequently became known as the King Father until his death in 2012. Sihanouk pursued an artistic career during his lifetime, and wrote several musical compositions. He was also known to be a film producer, director and actor, and produced a total of 50 films between 1966 and 2006.</description>

Inspired by controversies among the Jesuits as to whether the Cathay of Marco Polo's stories is the same country as China, his expeditionconclusively proved that the two countries are one and the same, and, according to Henry Yule,  made \"Cathay... finally disappear from view, leaving China only in the mouths and minds of men\".</description>

He was a student of many great Kung Fu masters and mastered the Lei Ga 李家 (Lee Style), Lung Ying 龍形派 (Southern Dragon Style), Lau Man Gaau 流民教 (Vagabond or Wanderer's Style), and Bak Mei 白眉派 (White Eyebrow Style).  He was responsible for codifying the latter.He began his study of the martial arts at the age of 7 with the Classical Chinese Medicine practitioner Sek Lam, who taught him the vagrant style. Jeung would later learn Li Style from Li Mung, (founded by Li Yi李義) who taught Jeung his family style. While he was studying martial arts with the Lam family, he became close friends with their son Lam Yiu Gwai, with whom he had much in common, and eventually studied under Yiu Gwai's uncle. Lam would later become known for disseminating Dragon Kung Fu much as Jeung would later become known for disseminating Bak Mei. Both were born in Huìyáng County (惠陽) in the Huizhou prefecture of Guangdong and a marriage between their families would eventually make them cousins. They both left Huizhou to build their futures in Guangzhou and did so by opening several schools together.After moving to Guangzhou, Jeung was defeated by the monk Lin Sang after which the monk referred Jeung to his own teacher Juk Faat Wan, who taught Jeung the art of Bak Mei over the next two or three years. Jeung had a background in the martial arts of the Hakka people, from his study of Li Mung's family style and the vagrant style. Because of this, Jeung's style of Bak Mei is associated  the dragon style of Lam Yiu Gwai due to the many years Jeung and Lam spent training together.</description>

      <description>Ja Lama (Mongolian: Жа Лама, also known as Dambiijantsan, Mongolian: Дамбийжанцан or Dambiijaa, Mongolian: Дамбийжаа, (1862–1922)) was an adventurer and warlord of unknown birth and background who fought successive campaigns against the rule of the Qing dynasty in western Mongolia between 1890 and 1922. He claimed to be a Buddhist lama, though it is not clear whether he actually was one, as well as a grandson and later the reincarnation of Amursana, the Khoid-Oirat prince who led the last great Mongol uprising against the Qing in 1757. He was one of the commanders of Mongolian forces that liberated Khovd city from Qing control in 1912.</description>

He was an advisor for the September 3 Society, one of China's recognized political parties.Qigong was born into a Manchu family in Beijing in 1912. Both his great-grandfather and grandfather were Jinshi, the highest Chinese academic title roughly equivalent to a doctoral. He was a descendant of the Yongzheng Emperor through his son Hongzhou, and therefore a member of the Aisin Gioro imperial clan. Upon coming to prominence, he declined to use both the Manchu \"Aisin Gioro\" or sinicized Jin surname, and went by the legal surname of \"Qi\" to establish a name for himself removed from that of the Imperial family.</description>

      <description>Song Qing (simplified Chinese: 宋庆; traditional Chinese: 宋慶; pinyin: Sòng Qìng; Wade–Giles: Sung Ch'ing) (1820–1902) was a Chinese general who served the Imperial government during the First Sino-Japanese War and in the Boxer Rebellion.Song was a native of what is now Penglai City, Shandong Province. Passing his imperial examinations for bureaucratic positions, he was assigned as a magistrate to what is now Bozhou in Anhui Province. During the Nien Rebellion, he led a local army against the rebels in southern Henan Province and northern Anhui Province. In 1862, he was promoted to general, and awarded the title of Baturu. He later joined his forces to that of the Huai Army, and assisted Sengge Rinchen in the suppression of the Taiping rebellion, and subsequently (in 1869) fought in the Dungan revolt under the command of Zuo Zongtang.From 1880, Song worked under Li Hongzhang towards overseeing the defence of Manchuria against the Russian Empire, and from 1882 had been stationed in strategic port of Lushunkou, home of the Beiyang fleet, but did little in the decade that he was  there to either strengthen its defenses or improve on the training of his men. After the Qing defeat at the Battle of Pyongyang in the First Sino-Japanese War, Li Hongzhang appointed Song as his deputy commander and assigned him the responsibility for defending the crossing of the Yalu River. However, the appointment was unpopular with his troops, who equated his lethargic attitude with cowardice, and who deserted in large numbers before and during the Battle of Jiuliancheng. Afterwards, Song assisted Viceroy Liu Kunyi at the equally disastrous Battle of Yingkou.After the war, in 1898, Song was assigned to the garrison of Jinzhou in Liaoning Province. He participated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, fighting the Allied army at the Battle of Yangcun. He died of illness in Beijing in 1902.</description>

She desired nothing more than to work in the menial jobs and while in China dedicated herself to the care of the poor and the orphans in the orphanage that she worked in.Her cause had its origins since the order received the encouragement of Pope Pius X despite it not beginning until a decade later. Following the recognition of two miracles Pope Pius XII celebrated her beatification on 7 November 1954.</description>

      <description>Jiang Qing (Chinese: 江青; Wade–Giles: Chiang Ch'ing, also known as Madame Mao; March 19, 1914 – May 14, 1991) was a Chinese actress and a major political figure during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76). She was the fourth wife of Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party of China. She used the stage name Lan Ping (蓝苹) during her acting career, and was known by many other names (see \"names\" section below). She married Mao in Yan'an in November 1938 and served as the inaugural \"First Lady\" of the People's Republic of China. Jiang Qing was best known for playing a major role in the Cultural Revolution and for forming the radical political alliance known as the \"Gang of Four\".Jiang Qing served as Mao's personal secretary in the 1940s and was head of the Film Section of the Communist Party's Propaganda Department in the 1950s. She served as an important emissary for Mao in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. In 1966 she was appointed deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. She collaborated with Lin Biao to advance Mao's unique brand of Communist ideology as well as Mao's cult of personality. At the height of the Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing held significant influence in the affairs of state, particularly in the realm of culture and the arts, and was idolized in propaganda posters as the \"Great Flagbearer of the Proletarian Revolution\". In 1969, Jiang gained a seat on the Politburo.Before Mao's death, the Gang of Four maintained control of many of China's political institutions, including the media and propaganda. However, Jiang Qing, deriving most of her political legitimacy from Mao, often found herself at odds with other top leaders. Mao's death in 1976 dealt a significant blow to Jiang Qing's political fortunes. She was arrested in October 1976 by Hua Guofeng and his allies, and was subsequently condemned by party authorities. Since then, Jiang Qing has been officially branded as having been part of the \"Lin Biao and Jiang Qing Counter-Revolutionary Clique\" (林彪江青反革命集团), to which most of the blame for the damage and devastation caused by the Cultural Revolution was assigned.  Though initially sentenced to death, her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983. After being released for medical treatment, Jiang Qing committed suicide in May 1991.</description>

      <description>Yixin (Manchu: ᡳ ᡥᡳᠨ I-hin, Chinese: 奕訢; 11 January 1833 – 29 May 1898), better known by his title Prince Gong (or Prince Kung), was an imperial prince of the Aisin Gioro clan and an important statesman of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in China. He was the sixth son of the Daoguang Emperor, a half-brother of the Xianfeng Emperor, and an uncle of the Tongzhi and Guangxu Emperors. At a young age, he was already noted for his brilliance and was once considered by his father as a potential heir. However, his fourth brother, Yizhu (the Xianfeng Emperor), eventually inherited the throne.In the aftermath of the Second Opium War in 1860, Prince Gong concluded negotiations with the British, French and Russians, and signed the Convention of Beijing on behalf of the Qing Empire. Following the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, Prince Gong launched the Xinyou Coup in 1861 with the aid of the Empress Dowagers Ci'an and Cixi, and seized power from a group of eight regents appointed by the Xianfeng Emperor on his deathbed to assist his young son and successor, the Tongzhi Emperor. After the coup, he served as Prince-Regent from 1861–65 and presided over the reforms implemented during the Tongzhi Restoration (1860–74). Despite his demotions in 1865 and 1874 for alleged corruption and disrespect towards the Emperor, Prince Gong continued to lead the Grand Council and remain a highly influential figure in the Qing government.The final decades of Prince Gong's career, under the Guangxu Emperor's reign, were marred by his conflict with conservative elements in the Qing imperial court – particularly his former ally, Empress Dowager Cixi – and ended with his death in relative disgrace. Having established in 1861 the Zongli Yamen, the Qing government's de facto foreign affairs ministry, Prince Gong is best remembered for advocating greater constructive engagement between the Qing Empire and the great powers of that era, as well as for his attempts to modernise China in the late 19th century.</description>

He left for China in January 1938, a week after Dr. Norman Bethune, the famous Canadian medical doctor. In China, he took the Chinese name of Nà Shì Róng. At that time, Japan was occupying part of China. On December 8, 1941, he was both director of the school of Taolou and that village's pastor when Canada, the United States, and Britain declared war on Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was immediately arrested and brought to Fengxian, 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) away, and put in house arrest in the church compound with two other Canadian priests. These three Canadian priests continued to operate a school from inside that same church compound in Fengxian. On March 18, 1943, they were executed by a Japanese officer for trying to preserve this school. In 1990, the people of Fengxian erected a monument to their memory.</description>

He would lure the girls into his office under the pretext of tutoring. The victims were between 7 and 14 years of age.Luo was arrested in 2006 when several former victims informed the police about his crimes. Investigators found that at least 26 girls had been raped. The official number of assault victims was deemed to be 39, but the actual number was probably higher due to some victims not wanting to give evidence. Luo raped one girl repeatedly through six years of her primary schooling. He raped another victim more than 10 times when she was 12 years old.At the time of his arrest, Luo was a school principal. He went on trial after confessing to all of the crimes and was sentenced to death on July 4, 2007. According to the court, \"Luo's crimes have seriously harmed the young girls' mental and physical health, disturbed normal teaching and had an extremely negative impact on society.\"Luo was executed in Gansu province on September 10, 2008.</description>

He re-enlisted with the regular army the following year, and continued to serve after the war. He was promoted to Colonel in April 1899. While in command of the 9th U.S. Infantry, he led his men during the Boxer Rebellion.  Colonel Emerson died at the Battle of Tientsin, China on July 13, 1900. He was one of the 150 American soldiers who were killed by Chinese sharpshooters defending the city; a bullet hit him in the stomach.\"It was on 13 July 1900, during the assault on Tientsin, China, in the face of murderous fire that the wounded Regimental Commander, Colonel Emerson H. Liscum seized the National Colors himself from his fallen Color Sergeant.Colonel Liscum stood fearlessly, directing the attack on the city walls until he too was mortally wounded. His last words to his men were 'Keep Up The Fire!' The assault continued with renewed vigor.  As a result of this action, the Regiment earned its foremost trophy, the Liscum Bowl.  The Colonel's last words, 'Keep Up The Fire!' have become the Regimental Motto.\"Possibly the most important piece of 20th century silver metalwork, The Liscum Bowl, was created in 1901 to honor the Colonel and his regiment.Fort Liscum in Valdez, in the Territory of Alaska, was named in his honor.</description>

      <description>Nurmemet Yasin (c. 1977 - reportedly died 2011) was a Uighur author who lived in the People's Republic of China. He was imprisoned for inciting separatism after the publication of his short story \"The Blue Pigeon\", and in 2013, was reported to have died in prison in 2011.Yasin published three poetry collections: First Love, Crying from the Heart, and Come on, Children. His short story \"The Blue Pigeon\" is a first-person narrative from the point-of-view of a blue pigeon king captured by pigeons of another color; he commits suicide rather than live his life in confinement. The Ministry of State Security objected to the story in part because blue is the color used by some factions of the Uighur independence movement. The story appeared in the Kashgar Literary Journal, a magazine based in Kashgar, Xinjiang. Yasin was arrested a month later.On 2 February 2005, a court in Kashgar sentenced Yasin to ten years' imprisonment on a charge of inciting separatism. Rebiya Kadeer, president of the World Uyghur Congress, called his arrest an example of \"the simple truth ... that whenever Uighurs contradict the official narrative of the benevolence of the Communist Party, they are severely punished\". Human Rights Watch cited it as an example of \"official policy that criticism or minority expression in art and literature can be deemed a disguised form of secessionism, its author a criminal or even 'terrorist'\".After suffering from ill health, on 1 January 2013, Yasin was reported to have died in Shaya Prison sometime in 2011. Amnesty International stated that \"if confirmed, the death of this young writer in prison is a shameful indictment of the Chinese government’s notion of justice\".</description>

      <description>Prof. Zhiming Liu (Chinese: 刘志明, born 10 October 1961, Hebei Province, China) is a computer scientist. He studied mathematics in Luoyang, Henan Province in China and obtained his first degree in 1982. He holds a master's degree in Computer Science from the Institute of Software of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1988),  and a PhD degree from the University of Warwick (1991). His PhD thesis was on Fault-Tolerant Programming by Transformations. After his PhD, Zhiming Liu worked as a guest scientist at the Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby in 1991–1992. Then he returned to the University of Warwick and worked as a postdoctoral research fellow on formal techniques in real-time and fault-tolerant systems till October 1994 when he became a university lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Leicester (UK). He worked at  UNU-IIST during 2002-2013 at UNU-IIST as Research fellow and Senior Research Fellow. He joined Birmingham City University (UK) in October 2013 as the Professor of Software Engineering. Zhiming Liu's main research interest is in the areas of formal methods of computer systems design, including real-time systems, fault-tolerant systems, object-oriented and component-based systems. His research results have been published in mainstream journals and conferences. His joint work with Mathai Joseph work on fault tolerance gives a formal model that defines precisely the notions of fault, error, failure and fault-tolerance, and their relations. It also gives the properties that models of fault-affected programs and fault-tolerant programs in terms of model transformations. They proposed a design process for fault-tolerant systems from requirement specifications and analysis, fault environment identification and analysis, specification of fault-affected design and verification of fault-tolerance for satisfaction of the requirements specification. In collaboration with Zhou Chaochen and Anders Ravn, et al., he also developed a Probabilistic Duration Calculus for system dependability analysis. His recent work with He Jifeng and Xiaoshan Li on the rCOS theory of semantics and refinement of object-oriented and component-based design is being developed into a method with tool support for component-based and model-driven software development.Zhiming Liu is the founder of International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC), the International Symposium on Formal Aspects of Component Software (FACS), and International Symposium On Foundations of Health Information Engineering and systems (FHIES). He has served as a PC chair for a number of conferences and PC members of a number of conferences. He has also edited a number of books. Zhiming Liu is married to Hong Zhao with two sons, Kim Chang Liu and Edward Tanze Liu.</description>

He was married to a woman from the Zhaobao village, only a few miles north east of the Chen Village (Chenjiagou); the home of the Chen Family famous for their martial arts. After moving to the Zhaobao Village, Chen Qingping learned Zhaobao taijiquan from Zhang Yan (张彦). He continued to develop the martial arts that were taught to him by a family elder Chen Youben (陳有本) (credited as the creator of the Chen Style Small Frame) alongside Zhaobao taijiquan. Chen Qingping later became famous in his own right and taught many Zhaobao taijiquan. His main disciple He Zhaoyuan passed on this art which later developed into He family Taijiquan. Another disciple Li Jingyan, created the Hulei style Taijiquan by combining his art with other martial arts popular in the local area where he lived.Chen Qingping, along with being credited with being a major influence in the development of the Zhaobao style, is also credited as one of the teachers of Wu Yuxiang who later developed the Wu/Hao style taijiquan, sometimes referred to as the \"Scholar-style of Taijiquan\". Wu Yuxiang was recommended to Chen Qingping by Wu Yuxiang's primary teacher, Yang Luchan.</description>

      <description>Tongan Daopi (Chinese: 同安道丕; Japanese: Doan Dōhi) was a Zen Buddhist monk during the end of the Tang Dynasty and the beginning of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Very little is known about him. Traditional biographies record that he was the abbot of Tongan Monastery on Mount Fengchi near modern Nanchang. The earliest source of information on monks of this era is the Zutang ji (Patriarch's Hall Record), which was completed in 952, but it fails to mention Tongan Daopi as a disciple of his supposed teacher Yunju Daoying. The Zutang ji does, however, record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying. The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi. He is first explicitly mentioned in the Transmission of the Lamp, which was compiled around 1004. However, in that work, it does not mention Tongan Daopi as having any disciples. The commonly accepted version of his lineage holds that Tongan Guanzhi is Tongan Daopi's successor. However, this comes from Huihong's Sengbao zhuan, which was completed in 1119, much longer after Tongan's death than the other works. The Transmission of the Lamp instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of a Tongan Wei, in turn a student of Jufeng Puman, with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous Dongshan Liangjie. Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the Transmission of the Lamp, and neither with much information. However, Dayang Jingxuan, who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi, is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp, suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage. This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is much more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi as commonly accepted.</description>

      <description>Shenyang (Chinese: 沈洋; pinyin: Shěn Yáng; born March 20, 1984) is a Chinese bass-baritone singer. His repertoire encompasses operatic roles, chamber music and Lieder recitals. Shenyang was born in Tianjin, the son of professional musicians, but did not start singing until the age of sixteen, after his voice broke. He took inspiration from recordings of the German Lieder singer Hans Hotter. At age nineteen, he entered the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, where he studied with Zhou Xiaoyan at the Zhou Xiaoyan International Opera Center.At the Conservatory, in early 2007 he attended a masterclass given by soprano Renée Fleming. She arranged vocal coaching for him that spring at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, and he went on to win the 2007 BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition. After the win, noting confusion in the Western press over the name \"Shen Yang\", he decided to change its spelling to \"Shenyang\".Subsequently, he entered the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program and the artist diploma program at the Juilliard School. He gave the Juilliard's 2009 Alice Tully Vocal Arts Debut Recital, in which he sang a program in tribute to Hans Hotter, marking Hotter's centenary. His debut at the Metropolitan Opera came in April 2009, as Masetto in Don Giovanni. He sang the role of Colline in La Bohème at the Met in February 2010.Other awards he has won include a Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award in 2008, and Montblanc New Voices at Saint Petersburg’s White Nights Festival in 2010.In May 2011 he made a return visit to Shanghai to give a recital of Chinese art song at the Shanghai Grand Theatre, at which he declared his intention to promote that repertoire.</description>

His best known productions include the CCTV adaptations of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, namely Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Water Margin, as well as adaptations of Louis Cha's wuxia novels. He is also known for building large film cities with the support of local government authorities, sets that have later been developed into tourist attractions.Zhang's adaptations of Louis Cha's works are somewhat controversial in China. Reception to these productions are generally mixed as some feel his productions are largely overblown, muddled and bombastic, while others champion his large budget and use of scenic locations.</description>

Gao's parents were both veteran Communists, and People's Liberation Army (PLA) high officials. Both parents died when Gao was a small child, of a combination of the effects of malnutrition and very poor medical care. After their deaths, they  were hailed as revolutionary martyrs by the Maoist government, a title which protected Gao and her siblings from the worst excesses of the Cultural Revolution but did not spare Gao extreme hardship, persecution and even torture.As a child, Gao was a diligent student, and her parents' influence as well as her hard study helped her become a Young Pioneer and a Red Guard. As a teenager during the Cultural Revolution, Gao joined the PLA to avoid being sent to the countryside for reform through hard labor, the fate of millions of other young Chinese men and women. She excelled in the army until she was denounced by her sister as a \"bourgeois decadent\" and dismissed. Gao was sent to work in an electronics factory, where she contracted Ménière's disease. She was the victim of domestic abuse from her husband, and then imprisoned and persecuted at the hands of the Chinese security police. In 1994, Gao moved to England to be with her British husband, whom she met via a written correspondence following an advertisement placed in the UK's Saga magazine.In 2000, as a British citizen, Gao published her memoir of her life's experiences under Mao's regime, To The Edge Of The Sky, stating that she \"wanted the world to know the truth about China\" (dustjacket).Gao currently lives and works in the UK.</description>

She won four gold medals at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, helping Singapore to sweep the women events as well as the mixed doubles.Zhang has defeated her higher-ranked fellow Singaporean, Li Jiawei, 3 times to date: once at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games in the women singles finals; another at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in the mixed doubles finals partnered by Cai Xiaoli against Li and her teammate, Yang Zi; and in the women singles finals in the same Games, winning four out of five gold medals for the country.In the Athens Olympics 2004, she went to the Games with no other target than to perform at her best. Zhang Xueling played her game and surprised the nation when she defeated 14th seed, Korea’s Lee Eun Sil and Japan’s table tennis prodigy Ai Fukuhara, to secure a position in the quarter-finals, before losing to the vastly experienced Korea's Kim Hyang Mi.However, Zhang has resigned in February, and has returned to Shanghai to join her husband, Zheng Qi. Zheng Qi was the Ex-Assistant Table Tennis Coach for the Singapore's Men's Team. Zhang's departure was due to Wang Yuegu, another Chinese-born Table Tennis Player, who has just received her Singaporean citizenship in February 2007.</description>

      <description>Ho Ho Ying (Chinese: 何和应; pinyin: Hé HéYīng) is a Singaporean abstract artist known for his avant-garde Chinese calligraphy and his Abstract Expressionistic works of art unique to Asian ideology. He is also an accomplished author under his reputed moniker 子木(Zǐ Mù), and an art critic for the Singapore visual arts community.Ho was born the eldest of five children, in Hainan. When he was born, his father had left the family to come to Kuala to work as a cook for a British family. Much of his childhood years was spent with his mother, a housewife on the island, and at the outbreak of Second Sino-Japanese War Ho and his mother had escaped the invaders' capture and reunite with the elder Ho in Kuala Lumpur in 1941. He was 5 when he arrived in the city, only to find that the city had fallen to the Japanese a year later. Life was harsh, but the studious boy continued his education with the Chung Hwa Confucian Primary School (尊孔小学）. In school, he learnt basic Chinese calligraphy and art lessons in class, copying drawings made by his teacher on the blackboard. In his free time, he would immerse himself at comic book stalls along Petaling Street (Chinese: 茨厂街; pinyin: cíchǎng jiē)， poring through Chinese wuxia comics (Chinese: 连环书; pinyin: liánhuán shū) and copying the comic book characters back home. He continued school at Chung Hwa Confucian High School (尊孔中学） until in 1951, when his family relocated to Singapore. He attended the Chinese High School, and developed strong interest in art under the influence of school teachers Liu Kang and Chen Wen Hsi. As he was a poor and could not afford art materials, Chen would often offer him money to buy the art materials. Ho's confidence in his art grew as he was proficient with Chinese calligraphy and often won awards in school. When he was 18 years old, his mother died of cervical cancer shortly after giving birth to his youngest sister. Without their mother, Ho had to take on the responsibility of taking care of his siblings and a 4-and-half months old infant sister, while his father was away working in a British household. As his father earned little as a cook, Ho often had to seek credit for food and provisions from shop owners.In 1962 Ho graduated from Nanyang University with a Bachelor (Arts) in Chinese Language and Literature. In 1963, Ho along with seven other artists Wee Beng Chong, Tong Siang Eng, Tay Chee Toh, Tan Yee Hong, Johnda Goh and Ng Yat Chuang frequently gathered together to discuss the development of the country’s fine art, and came to develop a singular thought that modern art for Singapore should be explored with loft and zeal. And so in October that year they founded the Modern Art Society, and launched their First Modern Art Exhibition at the National Library. In 1975, Ho was presented with an award the Malay arts group APAD (Angkatan Pelukis Aneka Daya) for his contribution in promoting art among different racial art groups in Singapore and uniting various ethnic art organisations.Ho's art evolved through his years, from Chinese calligraphy aesthetics ingrained in him when he was a schoolboy, to Western art influences by Impressionism and by mother-and-child paintings by Fauvist masters. In the 1950 - 60s, Ho found his true calling in his artistic expressions, when he laid eyes on Nature-themed semi-abstract paintings and Surrealism for the first time. He was especially enthralled by the free movements of American artists like Jackson Pollock and other artists existing at the time of his youth. This new spirited aesthetic resonated with the Taoist saying, Let thinking be like a bird in the sky - a saying that lived close to his art throughout his life. It inspired him to live freely in his canvas, escaping from the world of rigidity and systemic restrictions that humans live in. It enabled him to break boundaries in his expression on, and beyond the canvas. Together with his penchant for blue, red and black colours on his palette, his paintings show a unique artistic identity that is signature to Ho Ho Ying.</description>

Hong was the longest serving disciple for the Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan (陈式太极拳) master Chen Fake (陈发科, 1887–1957). Starting in 1930, Hong trained uninterrupted with Chen for fifteen years.  In 1956, Hong moved to Jinan (济南), Shandong Province (山东省).  There, he practiced and researched the meaning of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan.  He expressed his own understanding of the ch'uan through his teachings and his writings.  His theories and training principles are now known as the Practical Method for Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan (陈式太极实用拳法). Through the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, Hong maintained his dedication to the enrichment of his art.  In the Era of Restructuring, Hong had trained a new generation of Chen Stylists and wrote several articles to illuminate the mysteries of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan.  As China opened up to the international community, Hong was rediscovered as an important linkage to this ancient Chinese martial arts tradition.  T'ai chi enthusiasts from all over the world would come to train with this remarkable man.  Fame and fortune did not change Hong. He remains steadfast to the ideals of the Tao.  Near the end of his life, old and in ill health, he would still maintain his daily t'ai chi training schedule and looked forward to doing Push hands with his students.  In 1996, aged 90 (according to the Chinese calendar), Hong died.  Hong is survived by his family, his dedicated disciples and the lasting legacy of his Practical Method.</description>

Guinness World Records had returned the title of world’s tallest man to him after Ukrainian Leonid Stadnyk took over the title briefly. After Stadnyk refused to be measured under new guidelines, which required him to be independently measured by Guinness World Records’s adjudicators, the title was returned to Xishun.On September 17, 2009, Turkey's Sultan Kösen overtook Bao Xishun as the tallest living man in the world, when he was measured by Guinness World Records, standing 2.46 metres (8 ft 1 in) tall.</description>

As of July  2001 Professor Bartlett had lectured over 1,742 times since September, 1969 on Arithmetic, Population, and Energy. Bartlett regarded the word combination \"sustainable growth\" as an oxymoron, since even modest annual percentage population increases will inevitably equate to huge exponential growth over sustained periods of time. He therefore regarded human overpopulation as \"The Greatest Challenge\" facing humanity.</description>

After defeating all challengers, Chen attracted a group of students that included many already well known martial artists. Chen Fake was a martial artist and not a scholar and so he did not leave a written record of his achievements.  His life story was recorded and told by his sons or students, notably Hong Junsheng.  By the time of his death in 1957, Chen had established a martial arts tradition of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan that is practiced around the world.</description>

In 1935 he emigrated to the USA, where he took up postgraduate studies at the University of California at Berkeley and later joined the staff. He became professor in 1950. In 1955 he was elected as Academician of Academia Sinica, Republic of China.Li spent his entire academic career studying the pituitary-gland hormones. In collaboration with various co-workers, he isolated several protein hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal cortex to increase its secretion of corticoids. In 1956, Li and his group showed that ACTH consists of 39 amino acids arranged in a specific order, and that the whole chain of the natural hormone is not necessary for its action. He isolated another pituitary hormone called melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and found that not only does this hormone produce some effects similar to those produced by ACTH, but also that part of the amino acid chain of MSH is the same as that of ACTH.</description>

Some of her songs show the influence of trip hop, bossa nova, and the music of China's ethnic minorities, such as the Jino people, whom she visited in Xishuangbanna as a child.In 1996 she went to Kunming to study. In high school, she began writing songs and joined a band. The band recorded a demo, which impressed the musician Xiao Ke, who heard it in approximately 2001 while recording traditional music in Yunnan, but was unable to locate her. Several months later, she came to Beijing for a university students' original music competition, for which Xiao Ke was a judge; she won the awards for best lyrics and best group, and Xiao Ke invited her to join the label he had founded.Cao moved to Beijing in 2002, where she began working as an assistant at Xiao Ke's label. Soon thereafter she signed to the label. She released her first CD, Black Perfume (黑色香水), in 2003. The album was poorly promoted and sold poorly, but she gradually achieved renown via discussion of her works on Chinese blogs.Her second album, Meet Me (遇见我), was released in 2005 on the Tai You Wen Hua (钛友文化) label, selling over 100,000 copies and winning several awards. In the same year, she changed the written form of her name from 曹芳 to 曹方. Her five-track EP, Farther Than the Sky (比天空还远), was released on her own label in late 2007.In 2008, GE Healthcare used her song \"In Summer\" (在夏天) in a television commercial for Healthcare Re-imagined. She has also composed songs for several other Chinese singers, including Jin Haixin, Qin Hailu, and the first Super Girl winner An Youqi.Her hobbies include drawing and lomography.</description>

      <description>Guo Shuang (郭爽) (born February 26, 1986) is a Chinese professional track cyclist. She won two bronze medals at the 2006 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, in Sprint and Keirin, and two silver medals at the 2007 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, again in Sprint and Keirin.Guo had an eventful semi-final in the sprint at the 2008 Summer Olympics, having won the first heat and conceded the second to her opponent Anna Meares, the third heat saw Guo come down the banking too steeply and her front wheel slipped from beneath her. The heat was re-run and although Guo won by a few millimetres, she was relegated for coming down the tack and pushing Meares onto the côte d'azure on the final lap. This put Meares through to the final ride-off for gold. Guo went on to win the final ride-off for the bronze against Willy Kanis.Guo competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. She and Gong Jinjie set a world record of 32.447 seconds in the qualification round of the team sprint event, which they then improved upon with 32.422 in the next round. They went on to finish first in the final against the German team, but were disqualified for an early relay, and were relegated to the silver medal instead.  Guo and Gong's coach Daniel Morelon maintains that the pair were \"robbed\" of the gold medal, and described it as an \"injustice\". He complained that the judges refused to provide a \"video footage of the race on slow motion\", and only provided a \"vague explanation\" for the infringement they had allegedly committed. However, the British cycling champions Victoria Pendleton and Jessica Varnish, who were also disqualified for a similar reason earlier on in the competition, accepted the judges decision and chose not to claim that they were unfairly robbed of a medal. Pendleton recovered and went on to win a gold medal in the women's keirin event with Guo Shuang coming 2nd.</description>

In March 1951, Huang decided to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to fight against the American-led United Nations forces in the Korean War. After joining the war, Huang became a runner and was later awarded the Meritorious Service, Third Class for his bravery. At the Battle of Triangle Hill in October 1952, Huang's unit was tasked with destroying an enemy blockhouse. According to official accounts, Huang hurled himself against a machine gun slit on the blockhouse after running out of ammunition, blocking enemy fire while sacrificing his life. As a result of his heroism, the Chinese forces overran the position while annihilating an significant amount of enemy soldiers. In one version of the story, it was also claimed that Huang's final action was specifically inspired by the Soviet war film Private Alexander Matrosov, which was in turn based on the real life exploit of Alexander Matrosov during the Great Patriotic War.Huang was posthumously given the title of \"Combat Hero, Second Class\", which was later upgraded to \"Combat Hero, Special Class\". The North Korean government also awarded Huang with the title of \"Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\", a Gold Star Medal and the Medal of the National Flag, First-Class.</description>

      <description>Ting-Xing Ye (born 1952) is a Chinese- Canadian author of young adult novels, as well as Leaf In A Bitter Wind, a best-selling autobiographical account of her life in Maoist China.Ye was born in Shanghai, China, in 1952, the fourth of five children. Her parents were a factory owner and his wife. Ye's parents died when she was a small child, leaving Ye and her four siblings in the care of her Great-Aunt. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye and her family were condemned as having \"bad blood\" and persecuted by the Communist regime, because their father had been a boss in a factory. At sixteen, like millions of other young Chinese men and women, Ye was exiled to a prison farm to \"learn from the peasants\" and be \"reformed\" by hard labor. On the farm, Ye was persecuted and suffered torture at the hands of her leaders.Ye spent six years laboring on the prison farm, before being admitted to Beijing University. She took a degree in English Literature, then began a seven-year career as English interpreter for the national government in Shanghai. During that time she met her future husband, Canadian writer and educator William E. Bell who taught English at the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing. Ye came to Canada in 1987. She published her autobiography, detailing her life in Mao's China, in 1997. She published her first picture book in 1998. Ye also writes Young Adult fiction and non-fiction.</description>

(Southern Song Dynasty), was a famous Chinese Buddhist monk, calligrapher, idealist philosopher, and is the founder of the Kenchō-ji sect, which is a branch of the Rinzai school. He entered temple life at the age of thirteen. Due to the Mongol Conquest of the Song Dynasty in China in 1246, also driven by the new trend that Zen monks of the Southern Song Dynasty increasingly tended to voluntarily go to Japan to preach Zen Buddhism, plus the influences of his teachers and friends, he sailed to Japan to preach Zen Buddhism, and later moved to Kamakura, where he took charge of Kenchō-ji (建長寺). after having accepted the invitation of Hōjō Tokiyori (北條時賴) in 1253. His calligraphy was famous in Japan, especially Rule of Zen (法语规则). Daolong died in Kenchō-ji, and was given the Posthumous Name as Dajue Zen Master (大覺禅師, Daikaku Zenji in Japanese) by Emperor Go-Uda (後宇多天皇). Throughout his lifetime, he made great contributions to promote Sino-Japanese cultural interactions.</description>

Y. Tung, was a Chinese shipping magnate, the founder of the Orient Overseas Line (now Orient Overseas Container Line or OOCL). He was the father of Tung Chee Hwa, the first chief executive of the Hong Kong S.A.R..At the peak of his career, he owned a shipping fleet with over 150 freight ships; his fleet's cargo capacity exceeded 10 million tons. He was one of the world's top seven freight moguls; he was often called the Onassis of the Orient.Tung believed in the importance of education. In September 1970, he bought the famous ocean liner RMS Queen Elizabeth to convert it into a floating university S.S. Seawise University to keep the World Campus Afloat program alive. On 9 January 1972, the ship caught on fire during refurbishing and sank into Hong Kong's harbour. The wreckage of the ship was featured in the James Bond movie, The Man with the Golden Gun. He did not give up the plan because of this setback. He bought a smaller ocean liner Atlantic to complete the plan. He cooperated with various universities (e.g. University of Pittsburgh) to run the academic sea programme with the Institute of Shipboard Education entitled Semester at Sea.Politically Tung was aligned with Kuomintang regime of  the Republic of China on Taiwan; indeed the company emblem of the OOCL is a plum blossom, the national flower of the Republic of China. After his death, however, the OOCL went into financial trouble, and it was the government of the People's Republic of China which rescued the company from the brink. This paved the way for C.Y.Tung's son, Tung Chee Hwa, to become the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China in 1997.</description>

      <description>Cheng Tin Hung or Zheng Tianxiong (1930–2005) was an influential taijiquan master and the founder of \"Wudang taijiquan\". He was based in Hong Kong, China, and sometimes attracted controversy for his attitude and approach to the teaching and practice of his martial art. Also known as the \"Tai Chi Bodyguard\" for his enthusiastic defence of Taijiquan as a martial art, he took part in full contact competitions as a young man and also trained some of his students to do the same during the 1960s, '70s and '80s.Though closely associated with the Wu school of taijiquan, he founded a separate organisation called the Hong Kong Tai Chi Association (香港太極總會) which is now run by his wife Chan Lai Ping(陳麗平).Cheng Tin Hung produced a series of books and VCDs on the subject of Taijiquan and was also involved in the production of the 1974 Hong Kong movie called The Shadow Boxer (Shaw Brothers). He appears in the opening scenes and some of his techniques were also used within the fight scenes of the movie proper.During the 1980s, Cheng Tin Hung travelled to the UK to promote Taijiquan with one of his students Dan Docherty, and also produced a joint publication with him called Wutan Tai Chi Chuan.During the 1990s Cheng Tin Hung's taijiquan career slowly drew to a close with the onset of diabetes and its debilitating effects; he finally passed from this world in 2005.</description>

      <description>Shi Suxi (释素喜) born Geng Jinzhu (耿金柱: Dengfeng, 24 September 1924 (Chinese lunar calendar) – 9 March 2006 (Gregorian) / 9 February (Chinese lunar)) was a Chinese Buddhist priest, and abbot of the Shaolin Monastery. His disciples include Shi De Yang, current master of the fighting monks, and Shi Deru. Thanks to the efforts of Suxi and a few other monks, the history of Shaolin was preserved through a long drought in Dengfeng and the Chinese Cultural Revolution.At the age of 30 or 31 Suxi suffered a stroke, and was later diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Around 1983 he began to lose some control in his legs and feet, but he continued to practice and teach kung fu until late in his life. His health continued to decline in the 1990s, causing him to resign as abbot, but despite being wheelchair-bound and having speech difficulties he continued to teach verbally on the importance of Chan and martial arts.Shortly before his death, Suxi was visited by the appointed abbot of the Shaolin Monastery, Shi Yongxin. Suxi held Yongxin's hand and said, \"Shaolin is Chan [zen], not martial arts.\" (Chinese: 少林是禅不是拳; pinyin: Shàolín shì Chán, bùshì Quán) These are widely regarded as his message to future generations and is a theme he repeated throughout his career.</description>

He grew up during the turbulent Cultural Revolution, did not follow the pack of Chinese contemporary artists who embraced the international vogue for installation art as his country began opening up to the West in the 1980s. \"I walked away from the cultural confusion of the time and turned back to traditional folk art,\" he says.From the first look, his red tissue-paper tableaux, with their centermost, adjust, mandala-like frames, look like antiquated calligraphic goes with falling streams of hand-drawn elements skimming over the musings of sages. In reality, those vertical lines of red checks are made up of the negative-space from Lu's greater outlines.</description>

He was born in Qin, Shanxi province, China.  Over his literary career, Wen became regarded as the first truly distinctive writer of ci, the song-verse style of poetry that dominated Chinese poetry during much of the late Tang dynasty and the Song dynasty.  Most of his poems are \"boudoir\"-style verses that described the opulent furnishings and gardens of solitary women and their hidden desires. This style of poetry was commonly used for romantic communications between men and women in the entertainment districts of the Chinese capital Chang'an during the Tang dynasty.Yu Xuanji was among his followers.</description>

He graduated from the Changchun Normal Academy in 1987, and is currently a lecturer at Changchun University.In 1999, Huang Yan began a series of paintings/photographs of traditional Chinese landscape paintings using the human body as a canvas, called Chinese Landscapes. Both Feng Boyi and Ai Weiwei noticed his artwork, including it in their controversial Fuck Off exhibition in 2000 in Shanghai. His art can relate to Chinese people and their culture, even though it is still considered contemporary art. The landscape paintings he uses come from the Song Dynasty, which is what most consider the most \"Chinese-looking\". On the other hand, the human body was seldom used in ancient Chinese art, which is what makes this art very contemporary.</description>

      <description>Bian Zhilin (Chinese: 卞之琳; pinyin: Biàn Zhīlín; Wade–Giles: Pien Chih-lin, 1910–2000) was a 20th-century Chinese poet, translator and literature researcher.Bian was born in Haimen, Jiangsu on December 8, 1910, and liked to read classical and modern Chinese poems when he was very young. In 1929, he entered the English department of Beijing University to study. During this time he was greatly influenced by the English romantic poems and French symbolic poems, and began to write poems by himself. The poetry anthology The Han Garden Collection (《汉园集》) co-written by Bian, Li Guangtian and He Qifang, was published in 1936.Bian's poems were related to the Crescent School (新月派) which advocated modern metrical poetry, but his style was closer to the Chinese symbolists. He once coedited the magazine New Poems (《新诗》) with the representative figure of Chinese symbolist poetry Dai Wangshu. Bian's poems of this time represented his dissatisfaction and thinking of the social reality as a young intellectual, showed his quick perception, and sometimes hard to understand. He sought for strangeness of words, tidiness of syllables, and many of his poems were full of a melancholy mood.During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he taught at Sichuan University and National Southwestern Associated University. From 1938 to 1939 he took a visit to Yan'an and Taihangshan, and once taught at the institute of Lu Xun's art and literature. Bian compiled his A Selection of 10 Years' Poetry (1930–1939) (《十年诗草》) in 1941, and it was published in the next year. In 1946, he went to the Nankai University to teach.In 1949, Bian became a professor of the foreign language department of Beijing University. From 1964, he served as a researcher of the Institute of Foreign Literature of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (中国社会科学院外国文学研究所).</description>

He was born on February 6, 1989 in Pawo village, in Derge, eastern Tibet, and recognized by Tai Situ Rinpoche in 1991. He was enthroned a year later at Surmang Monastery at a ceremony presided over by Domkhar Rinpoche, a high Kagyu lama and Choseng's uncle. The monastery's late abbot (and Choseng Trungpa's predecessor), was Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.He has studied the traditions of Surmang under the tutelage of the late Lama Kenla, (1932–2003), and received his early monastic education at the shedra at Palpung Monastery. He studied at Surmang Namgyal-tse until 2008, and currently studies at Serthar Institute.The name Choseng is a contraction of Chokyi Sengay (Tibetan: ཆོས་ཀྱི་སེང་གེ་, Wylie: Chos-kyi Seng-ge), which means \"Lion of Dharma.\"In 2001, he met for the first time with Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, the son of his previous incarnation, Chögyam Trungpa.</description>

He came to Singapore at the outbreak of Sino-Japan War in 1937, and taught art at The Chinese High School and Nan Chiau Girls High School (now Nan Chiau High School) for a year. In 1938, he was appointed as the first principal of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.Lim was a dedicated art educator and an accomplished painter in Singapore, and have taught many art students - some on to becoming accomplished Singaporean artists. He was also the first to articulate the notion of a 'Nanyang style' art that involved local and South-east Asian tropical representations using Western painting techniques. As such, Lim persuaded his peers Cheong Soo Pieng, Chen Wen Hsi, Chen Chong Swee and Liu Kang to seek inspiration from their Balinese excursion in 1952, developing what is known today as the Nanyang School of Painting.Lim was conferred with the Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Award) for his outstanding achievements for the Academy, and the society on 3 June 1962. He was the first artist to be conferred the award by the Singapore Government. Lim died on 14 February 1963 due to lung cancer.</description>

He became a student of U.S. culture, studying English, adopting Western dress, and converting to Christianity. He joined the seminary and in 1892 became the first Chinese Presbyterian Minister on the American West Coast. He was assigned to a ministry in Los Angeles, but after a fire destroyed his mission, he decided to focus his efforts on establishing a Chinese language newspaper instead. After a year of publishing his L.A.-based weekly, Hua Mei Sun Bo, Ng moved to San Francisco where he  wrote the first Chinese language daily outside of China: Chung Sai Yat Pao. His newspaper generally promoted an assimilationist viewpoint, encouraging Chinese American readers to adapt to North American values.Ng traveled the country speaking out against anti-Chinese legislation, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act. He also published books and pamphlets opposing discrimination against Chinese Americans.He was called \"an Oriental Mark Twain\".</description>

      <description>Tim Ralfe (27 October 1938 – 27 October 2000) was a Canadian television journalist for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation who provoked a controversial moment in Canadian political history. During the October Crisis on 13 October 1970, Ralfe interviewed then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and pointedly questioned Trudeau about the use of the military to protect cabinet ministers and senior officials, and the possible threat that this represented for civil liberties.About five minutes into the interview, Trudeau stated: \"Well, there are a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don't like to see people with helmets and guns. All I can say is, go on and bleed, but it is more important to keep law and order in the society than to be worried about weak-kneed people.\" Ralfe then asked how far Trudeau would go to deal with terrorists, and Trudeau famously responded, \"Well, just watch me\".Ralfe's persistence was condemned by CBC managers who accused him of being too aggressive during a time of national crisis. Peter Trueman, executive producer of national television news wrote a message to Ralfe on an open, inter-office teleprinter link. It said that Ralfe's questioning of Trudeau violated every journalistic standard that Trueman had ever heard of. Trueman ordered severe cuts to the video tape to eliminate Ralfe's most argumentative questions. He also insisted that a formal reprimand be placed on Ralfe's employment file. In his 1980 book, Trueman wrote that he regretted his actions.Ralfe was a reporter for CTV when in 1973 he exploited a loophole in Canadian law that allowed surreptitious recording under certain circumstances. He placed a recording device in the New Democratic Party caucus room at Parliament Hill then confronted party leader David Lewis with an audio tape of a meeting in that room. The report earned CTV a Michener Award the following year. Canadian law was later changed to further restrict such recordings.Ralfe was born in Shanghai, China in 1938 and returned to Canada with his parents before the Japanese invaded China. Ralfe graduated from Bedford Park Public School and Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute, then to Carleton University for journalism.He died on 27 October 2000 in Ottawa after suffering a heart attack two weeks before. He was 62 and worked as a consultant at that time.</description>

      <description>Yunju Daoying (Chinese: 雲居道膺; Japanese: Ungo Dōyō; Korean: Ungǒ Toyong; Vietnamese: Vân Cư Đạo Ưng) was a Zen Buddhist monk during the late Tang Dynasty. According to traditional biographies, he became a monk when he was 25 at Yanshou Temple, although he later left to study at Mount Nan before finally taking on Dongshan Liangjie as his teacher on Mount Dong. After receiving dharma transmission from Dongshan, he went to a place called Three Peak Hermitage, and finally to Mount Yunju, northeast of modern Nanchang in Jiangxi Province. Here he established Jenru Temple, where he taught for 30 years and eventually attracted 1,500 students.Amongst modern Caodong/Sōtō practitioners, Tongan Daopi is commonly regarded as Yunju's successor through whom the Caodong teaching descended. This view comes from Huihong's Sengbao zhuan, which was completed in 1119, long afer Yunju's life. Contemporary information, however, disagrees with this version of history. The Zutang ji (Patriarch's Hall Record), which was completed in 952, covers the life of Yunju Daoying, but does not mention Tongan Daopi as his disciple. The Zutang ji does, however, record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying. The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi. However, in the Transmission of the Lamp, which was compiled around 1004, Tongan Daopi is mentioned as a student of Yunju.The Transmission of the Lamp also claims that Tongan had no students himself. In other words, the Caodong school did not descend through Yunju as is commonly thought, but rather through another student of Dongshan Liangjie, namely Jufeng Puman. The scholar Morten Schlütter suggests that the lineage according to the Transmission of the Lamp is more likely correct because Dayang Jingshuan, who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Yunju, is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp, suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his own lineage.</description>

      <description>Zhenxie Qingliao (Chinese: 真歇清了; pinyin: Zhēnxiē Qīngliăo; Japanese: Shinketsu Seiryō; Korean: Chinhǒl Ch'ǒngyo; Vietnamese: Chân Yết Thanh Liễu), also known as Changlu Qingliao (Chinese: 長蘆清了; pinyin: Chánglú Qīngliăo; Japanese: Chōro Seiryō), was a Chinese Zen Buddhist monk during the Song Dynasty. He was born in Anchang, an ancient city in what is now Sichuan Province. According to traditional biographies, he became a monk at the age of eleven. The scholar Morten Schlütter calls Qingliao, along with his fellow student Hongzhi Zhengjue, \"the most illustrious representative of the Caodong tradition in the Song [Dynasty].\" Multiple sources contain a story about Qingliao regarding an event that took place after he received dharma transmission from his teacher Danxia Zichun. After leaving his teacher, he became the head monk at a monastery on Mt. Changlu, whose abbot was Zuzhao Daohe of the Yunmen school. Daohe offered to allow Qingliao to become the abbot of the monastery, inherit his robe, and serve as his heir. Qingliao said he would become abbot, but could not be Daohe's heir since Zichun had already given him dharma transmission. Daohe later left the monastery without passing on his position, but ultimately Qingliao was instructed by a fiscal commissioner named Chen to take charge of the monastery. The students there apparently were amazed at his degree of loyalty to his original teacher. This story has historical significance because it suggests that Qingliao could have accepted Daohe’s offer to essentially switch heirs, indicating that teacher-student transmission was probably more flexible than often thought. Zhenxie Qingliao is also remembered as the initial target of the koan advocate Dahui Zonggao's attacks on silent illumination-style meditation.</description>

She won a gold medal in the 3000 m relay event and a silver medal in the 500 m event in 2012.In 2014 Winter Olympics, she had been regarded as the favorite in 500 meters before the game, since she was 2nd on that distance in 2013-2014 season while the strongest Chinese skater Wang Meng was injured and couldn't participate. However, she fell down in the second lap in the semifinals and ranked 5th at last. She won a silver medal eight days later in 1000 meters.</description>

Early 1951, Qiu signed up with the Chinese Volunteer Army taking part in the Korean War. In October 1952, Qiu died as a martyr in the Korean War, and is considered by the Chinese government to be a war hero. In the struggle for Hill 391, Qiu and his squad mates crawled closer to the enemy position, using hay and twigs as natural camouflage. The UN troops used incendary bombs, dropped by airplanes, to try and smoke out the Chinese units. It is claimed Qiu got trapped in the ensuing brush fire and in order to not betray the 500 other Chinese soldiers taking part in the assault, he did not move and burned to death.</description>

      <description>Wei Guoqing (simplified Chinese: 韦国清; traditional Chinese: 韋國清; pinyin: Wéi Guóqīng; Zhuang: Veiz Gozcing) (2 September 1913 – 14 June 1989) was a Chinese government official, military officer and political commissar. He served on the Communist Party of China's Politburo (1973–82) and as Director of the People's Liberation Army's General Political Department (1977–82). Wei was one of the few members of the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Central Committees (1969–87) and the 10th through 12th politburos not purged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (GPCR) or Deng Xiaoping's backlash. He was also a Vice Chair of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (1975–89) and of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (1964–83).Wei was born in Donglan, Guangxi, to a poor Zhuang minority family. He joined the Chinese Red Army at the age of 16 (1929) and the CPC in 1931. He rose to the rank of battalion commander in the Seventh Army under Deng Xiaoping and was a regimental commander on the Long March. After the Long March he served in the 344th Brigade, and then marched south under Huang Kecheng's 5th Column in January 1940. By 1944, he commanded the 4th Division of the New Fourth Army, and later three columns (the 2nd, 10th and 12th) of the North Jiangsu Army in the Huai-Hai Campaign. In 1948, Wei held off the Nationalist 2nd Army Corps of Qiu Qingquan and  100 tanks of the 5th Corps under the command of Jiang Weiguo (Chiang Wei-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's son) in a decisive delaying action in the Huai-Hai Campaign. In 1949, Wei was deputy political commissar of General Ye Fei's Tenth Army Group of the Third Field Army.</description>

Then his t'ai chi ch'uan training began with Han Ch'ing-t'ang. In Zhejiang provincial Wushu Academy he became the student of Yang Chengfu at his age of 30's. After passing the entrance exam of Nanjing China Central Wushu Institute, he studied Xingyiquan, Pa Kua, Chin Na and Sanshou, Wudang Sword respectively with masters Chiang Jung-Ch'iao, Huang Pai-nien, Wu Chun-shan, Liu Pai-ch'uan and Huang Yuan-hsiu.In 1930 he became the champion in Zhejiang, in 1933 he scored the highest point in graduate exam of Nanjing China Central Wushu Institute, in 1948 he became the national champion of wrestling, in 1956 he got 2 titles in national Wushu Championship, in 1975 he was invited to be the national Wushu trainer.Jiang Yukun studied Da Jia (the original Big Frame) in Yang-style t'ai chi system from a martial arts approach. He learned and Xiao Jia (the Small Frame) Small Frame Yang Style from Gong Rongtian, who was a disciple of Yang Ban-Shou (the 2nd generation successor of the Yang Family). Jiang also learned Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan from Master Chen Ziming, the 17th generation successor of the Chen Family.One of the heritages of Yang Chengfu, the traditional 43 form Yang style, could come to the present day thanks to master Jiang Yukun. Fortunately this rarely practised form was passed on to his students. Yang style 43 form has high and low stands, beautiful circular moves and powerful yet relaxed actions with much details. 43 form has been created by Yang Chengfu just a few years before his death and undergone small edit by Master Jiang Yukun.</description>

      <description>Zhenzhou Puhua (Chinese: traditional: 鎮州普化, simplified: 普化, pinyin: Zhenzhou Pǔhuà; Japanese: Jinshu Fuke, honorifically Fuke Zenji (lit. \"Zen master Fuke\")—allegedly ca. 770-840 or 860), also called P'u-k'o, and best known by his Japanese name, Fuke, was a potentially mythical Chinese Chán (Zen) master, monk-priest, wanderer and eccentric, whose existence and many affairs were advanced and likely fabricated by the now defunct Fuke Zen or Hotto-ha sect, or sub-sect, of Japanese Rinzai Zen Buddhism in the 17th or 18th century with the publication of the later-disconfirmed document, the Kyotaku Denki (虚鐸伝記), probably first published around 1640. For the komusō (虚無僧) monks of the Fuke sect, he was considered the traditional antecedent—at least in spiritual or philosophical terms—of their order, which was formally established in Edo Japan. It is more likely that the ideological roots of the sect derived from the Rinzai poet and iconoclast Ikkyū and the monk Shinchi Kakushin (心地覺心) who traveled to and from China and Japan in the 13th century. Still according to some accounts the sect is simply a more direct derivative of the Rinzai school and its teachings.The few records of Puhua's life and affairs are those accounted, if only briefly, in several East Asian religious or historical references. One of the only credible sources on his life is to be found in the Tang Dynasty Record of Linji, wherein he is portrayed as an obscure student and eventual dharma heir of Panshan Baoji, as well as a friend, colleague, student and/or contemporary of Linji Yixuan, who founded the Linji (臨済宗 Rinzai) sect in China. This implies that he may have been a real individual, although the legends surrounding him in the Kyotaku Denki which connect him to the Fuke sect have been proven as fabrications created to further the komusōs' benefits under the Tokugawa shogunate.The legends surrounding Puhua were more recently mentioned in the Monumenta Nipponica, R.H. Blyth's A History of Haiku (published in 1963) as well as some of the writings of Osho, along with later publications concerning the Fuke-shū, the shakuhachi and related topics. In 1988 a shakuhachi learning and playing manual co-authored by the shakuhachi performer Christopher Yohmei Blasdel and the scholar Kamisango Yūkō was published; the work is entitled The Shakuhachi: A Manual for Learning (ISBN 978-1933606156), and thoroughly details the historicity of Fuke/Puhua and the precursors to Fuke Zen in China.</description>

It is known that she is petite, was born in 1971, smokes cigarettes, and does not speak English.  She grew up in a coal mining town in Jiangxi Province, daughter of engineers.  She was married in 2002.Hu migrated to Shenzhen in 1992, attracted by the public perception and entertainment media accounts of Shenzhen (designated as one of China's new Special Economic Zones) as a cosmopolitan city with opportunities for upward mobility.  She initially worked at a mineral water factory earning the equivalent of US$70 per month.   At night she would listen to radio call-in shows that were becoming popular in China under its new policy of \"Reform and Opening\".In late she called into a talk radio and mentioned her own hopes of becoming a show host, and gave out her phone number and address.  This led to many letters, but also to her employer firing her for using their telephone for personal purposes.  Out of work, she brought her resume to the radio station to ask for a job.  One producer decided to hire her as a host beginning December, 2002.  The show she hosted from 2003 through 2007 eventually became the top rated show in Shenzhen.  She was known for a \"smoky\" voice and calm but often critical tone.  Her show had wide appeal, especially to migrant workers, who would call in from their dormitories to discuss family, work, and their romantic lives.</description>

      <description>Guang Qin (廣欽, 1892–1986) was a renowned Buddhist monk, teacher and cultivator.Born Huang Wenlai in 1892 in Huian County, Fukien Province, China. Due to his family's extreme poverty, he was sold to the Li family. The Lei were not wealthy either and had a fruit growing business that allowed them to barely scrape together a living. His parents died in 1902 when he was only 11 years old. He realied how impermanent human life was and took refuge with Master Rui Fang of the famous Cheng Tian Chan Monastery. In 1927, he took ordination at the same monastery.From the very beginning, Guang Qin was an ascetic practitioner. In the monastery, one of his duties was to ring the morning wake-up bell. One morning, he accidentally over-slept and missed ringing the bell at the correct time. After that, he never lay down to sleep for the rest of his life and sat up in his sleep.In 1985 at the age of 95, on the first day of the Chinese New Year, he called together all of his disciples who were in charge of his different monasteries. He told them that he would pass away soon and that they should divide his relics among Cheng Tian Temple and other temples, monasteries and nunneries. He later went to Miao Tong Temple, the place where he would manifest stillness.On the fifth day of Chinese New Year, with all his disciples gathered around him he told them to recite Amitabha Buddha's name. He said, \"There is no coming and no going, nothing is happening.\" Then he smiled at his disciples and closed his eyes. He was so still that his disciples checked and discovered that he had died amidst the Amitabha chanting. Guang Qin died at the age of 95 in 1986.Photos that were taken by an anonymous disciple from Guang Qin's funeral displayed auspicious signs, such as lights pointing down at Guang Qin's casket and supposedly a faint silhouette which appears to look like Amitabha shine down upon the casket. Also, clouds forming a lotus flower was supposedly seen in the sky.One of Guang Qin's relics is among one of the relics being toured with the Maitreya Project Heart Relic Tour.</description>

      <description>Wumen Huikai (simplified Chinese: 无门慧开; traditional Chinese: 無門慧開; pinyin: Wúmén Huìkāi; Wade-Giles: Wu-men Hui-k'ai; Japanese: Mumon Ekai) (1183–1260) is a Song period Chán (Japanese:  Zen) master most famous as the compiler of and commentator on the 48-koan collection The Gateless Gate (Japanese: Mumonkan). Wumen was at that time the head monk of Longxiang (Wade-Giles: Lung-hsiang; Japanese: Ryusho) monastery.Wumen was born in Hangzhou and his first master was Gong Heshang. However, it was Zen master Yuelin Shiguan (月林師觀; Japanese: Gatsurin Shikan) (1143–1217) who gave Wumen the koan \"Zhaozhou’s dog\", with which Wu-men struggled for six years before he finally attained realization. After his understanding had been confirmed by Yuelin, Wumen wrote his enlightenment poem:A thunderclap under the clear blue skyAll beings on earth open their eyes;Everything under heaven bows together;Mount Sumeru leaps up and dances. (Aitken, p4)He received Dharma transmission in the Linji line (Japanese: Rinzai) of Zen from his master, Yuelin.In many respects, Wumen was the classical eccentric Chan master. He wandered for many years from temple to temple, wore old and dirty robes, grew his hair and beard long and worked in the temple fields. He was nicknamed \"Huikai the Lay Monk\". (Aitken, p4) At age 64, he founded Gokoku-ninno temple near West Lake where he hoped to retire quietly, but visitors constantly came looking for instruction.His teachings, as revealed in his comments in The Gateless Gate, closely followed the teachings of Dahui Zonggao (大慧宗杲; Wade-Giles: Ta-hui Tsung-kao; Japanese: Daei Sōkō) (1089–1163). The importance of \"Great Doubt\" was one of his central teaching devices. Wumen said, \"...[understanding Zen is] just a matter of rousing the mass of doubt throughout your body, day and night, and never letting up.\" (Yamada p xlii) In his comment on Case 1, Zhaozhou's dog, he called mu (無) \"a red-hot iron ball which you have gulped down and which you try to vomit up, but cannot\". (Yamada, p 14) Wumen believed in blocking all avenues of escape for the student, hence the \"gateless barrier\". Whatever activity the student proposed, Wumen rejected: \"If you follow regulations, keeping the rules, you tie yourself without rope but if you act any which way without inhibition you're a heretical demon. ... Clear alertness is wearing chains and stocks. Thinking good and bad is hell and heaven. ... Neither progressing nor retreating, you're a dead man with breath. So tell me, ultimately how do you practice?\" (Yamada, p xliii)</description>
